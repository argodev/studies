# Class 1: Defining the Topic

## Introduction

Let's start with a pop quiz. I'll save the answers until the end. Three questions:

1. Can someone tell me what all these things have in common? The Prosperity Gospel; Liberation Theology; Roman Catholicism.
2. What do these have in common? Christian conunseling or preaching that focuses entirely on your responsiblity; Christian counseling or preaching which tells you it's all your parents and society's fault; Christian counseling or preaching which emphasizes positive thinking?
3. And what about these? Characterizing the church's mission as "transforming culture"; Christian pacifism; and the church/state settlement which characterized the West from constantine to the time of the Reformation, whereby the power of the state and church ruled over one "Christian Europe."
