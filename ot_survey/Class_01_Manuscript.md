# Week 1: Introduction and Genesis 1-11

Welcome to the Old Testament core seminar! This is the beginning of 24 weeks through the whole Bible (12 this semester, 12 next). Ths class is designed for you to profit even if you get just a few weeks here and there. However, it's also designed such that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, because just as the whole Bible hangs together as a single narrative, these classes all fit together. To that end, I'd encourage you to try to come as often as possible and commit to taking the time to study the entire Bible this Fall and Spring. I will warn you that this course is derived from material that is 52 weeks in length,so we will be moving quite quickly (52 weeks down to 24). Even so, it is an opportunity to intentionally dive a bit deeper into God's word.

## Why study the Old Testament?

Now, before we begin, I'd like to focus in on the Old Testament and set up some specific goals for our next 12 weeks in these 39 books. Why should we study the Old Testament? Is it merely to have literary context for the New Testament? Let me lay out two purposes for studying the Old Testament.

1. First, the Old Testament reveals the character of God in a way that the New Testament does not. In the New Testament, we have the benefit of great clarity, and the benefit of considering God this side of Christ. But whereas the New Testament was written ina  generation, the Old Testament spans thousands of years. Further, we see God's character manifest through history in the Old Testament, there is a certain depth and richness that we take away. The difference is between a crystal-clear snapshot (as seen in the New Testament) and a slightly grainy, but hour-long movie on the other. It's one thing to read about God's patience in 2 Peter, for example ("The Lord is now slow in keeping his promises... but is patient with you...) (3:9). Yet it is quite another to see God's patience with his rebellious people in the desert of Sinai. And again in the promised Land, through the judges, and the monarchy, through exile, and even beyond. Same God. Sme promises. Same rebellion. Same patience. The old Testament offers a different lens with which to view the character of God.  There is a depth an drichness that we just can't experience in the Newe Testament.

1. Second: the Old Testament tells us about Jesus, and it does it in three ways:
   1. It is the context for the events of the New Testament, both historically and thematically. From Abraham's sacrifice on, for example, God spent 2,000 years getting us ready for the idea of a substitute sacrifice on our behalf. That's how we undersand what Jesus did on the Cross
   1. The Old Testament is the source of, by one count, 295 references and 600 allusions in the New Testament that help us understand who Jesus is. THe New Testament writers clear expect a working knowledge of the Old Testament.[^1]
   1. And, more than just an aid for konwing the New Testament better, Jesus Himself says that the Old Testament teaches about him (Luke 24:44). This was the Jesus who made the astonishing claim that he came to fulfill the law and the prophets (5:17). The Bible, in its entirety, is a book about Jesus.

If Ic ould summarize the entire Old Testament in a simple phrase, it would be "promises made." We learn of our _need_ for God's promises - we are sinners, unable to save ourselves and condemned to hell by a just God. But we learn of our promise-making God, who in his mercy promises us what we could never achieve ourselves. Similarly, as we'll see next Spring, the message of the New Testament is "promises kept.". Particularly in Jesus Christ.

So, what does "promises made" look like? Before we look at the first part of Genesis, I'm going to run through the Old Testament from beginning to end. Not once, but three different times. The first time will be just to set your bearings - introducing you to each book of the Old Tesament. Then we'll step back and run through again, this time looking at our need for God's promises, the story of his holiness and our sin. Finally, we'll look at the story of his promise, which ultimately carries us into the ministry of Jesus Christ.

## Historical Overview

The Bible beings, on page 1, in Genesis 1:1, with God's creation of the universe - from _nothing_ and the crown of his creation, mankind, made in his image, to rflect his character. This is chapters 1 and 2 of the Bible. Then, in chapter 3, God's first humans disobey him and the whole cosmos falls into ruin as a consequence.

The narrative continues with things going from bad to worse. In Genesis 12, God begins his plan of redemption, calling Abrham to be the first of his new people. God leads him - and ultimately his family - to his place, the promised land of Canaan. After a series of providential twists, these people end up as slaves in Egypt, yet they also quickly reproduce and become a great nation.[^2]
