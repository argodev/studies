## Introduction

Welcome to the Old Testament core seminar! This is the beginning of 24 weeks through the whole Bible. Ths class is designed for 
you to profit even if you get just a few weeks here and there. However, it's also designed such that the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts, because just as the whole Bible hangs together as a single narrative, these classes all fit
together. To that end, I'd encourage you to try to come as often as possible and commit to taking the time to study the 
entire Bible this Fall and Spring. I will warn you that this course is derived from material that is 52 weeks in length,
so we will be moving quite quickly (52 weeks down to 24). Even so, it is an opportunity to take our time and dive a
a bit deeper into God's word.

### Why study the Old Testament?

Now, before we begin, I'd like to focus in on the Old Testament and set up some specific goals for our next 12 weeks in 
these 39 books. Why should we study the Old Testament? Is it merely to have literary context for the New Testament? Let
me lay out two purposes for studying the Old Testament.

1. First, the Old Testament reveals the character of God in a way that the New Testament does not. In the New Testament,
we have the benefit of great clarity, and the benefit of considering God this side of Christ.

2. Second: the Old Testament tells us about Jesus, and it does it in three ways:

## Historical Overview

### Narrative Books

### The Writings

## The Story of the Promise

## Conclusion
