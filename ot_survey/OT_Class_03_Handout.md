# Part 2: Exodus 20-40

## Context

- Historical Context

  mid 15th century BC, at the foot of Mount Sinai

- Redemptive-Historical Context

  Promises are being fulfilled!

  Israel now directed how to be Yahweh’s people	

## Theme

> God is establishing the covenant terms to direct His people in how to live in fellowship with Him since He will now dwell with them.

## Structure

(look at “chiasm” on the back of your handout)

## Covenant Obligations (Chapters 20-23)

### The Ten Commandments (Chapter 20)

### Where do commandments fit into a covenant of grace?

- The law teaches God’s people _how_ to image him
- Galatians 3:17-19: the law leads us to Christ
- Israel is _already_ saved

## Covenant Disobedience and Covenant Grace – Exodus 32-34

The Glory of God – Exodus 33:12-23

## The Tabernacle – Exodus 25-31, 35-40:1-33

1. Where atonement for sins is made

   Hebrews 9:26

1. Only through an atonement for sins does anyone have fellowship with God

   John 14:6

1. Where God reveals Himself

   Hebrews 1:2

1. Where God is reconciled with His people

   Romans 5:11

1. Where God’s glory dwells

   John 1:14

1. A physical place for the invisible God to manifest Himself

   Colossians 2:9

1. Where God can be known

   John 14:7

## Covenant Presence

Promised: Chapter 24

Realized: Exodus 40_34-38

[^1]: Adapted from the _ESV Study Bible_.

[^2]: Notice the mirroring effect (a "chiasm").  Sections II and VI are related in terms of promise and fulfillment, and sections III and V are related in terms of directions and obedience.  That puts section IV in the middle of this chiasm, making it a central and crucial part of the book.  And inside Section IV there is another chiasm.  Chapters 32 and 34 are related in terms of covenant broken and covenant restored, with chapter 33 being highlighted in the middle.  What is interesting about chapter 33 is that that is where we most clearly see the gospel in this second half of Exodus: Moses intercedes for the sinners, and Moses himself is hidden in the cleft of the rock so that he won’t be destroyed by the glory of the LORD.
