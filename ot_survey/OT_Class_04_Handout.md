## A Study Outline for Leviticus

i. Leviticus 1-15 – LAW*
    a. Chapters 1-7: Offerings
    a. Chapters 8-10: Obedience of Priesthood

*Notice that the flow of the book follows a real gospel train of thought:  First there are laws to tell the Israelites how they might approach Yahweh (part I).  But when they fail in their obedience, provision is made for them in the form of a substitutionary sacrifice (part II).  Then, from that position of forgiveness and grace, the people are called to live holy lives (part III).
