# Week 1: Introduction and Genesis 1-11

Welcome to the Old Testament core seminar! This is the beginning of 24 weeks through the whole Bible (12 this semester, 12 next). Ths class is designed for you to profit even if you get just a few weeks here and there. However, it's also designed such that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, because just as the whole Bible hangs together as a single narrative, these classes all fit together. To that end, I'd encourage you to try to come as often as possible and commit to taking the time to study the entire Bible this Fall and Spring. I will warn you that this course is derived from material that is 52 weeks in length,so we will be moving quite quickly (52 weeks down to 24). Even so, it is an opportunity to intentionally dive a bit deeper into God's word.
