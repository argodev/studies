## Genesis 3:1-24 (The Fall)

_But mankind’s first parents choose to set themselves up as equals with God, disobeying him and incurring the just wrath of God.  While expelled from that pristine fellowship with God, they do not receive the complete wrath they deserve, for God has already begun a plan to overturn the curse of sin by placing enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman._

### The Prohibition – Genesis 2:15-17

Three levels of enmity:
