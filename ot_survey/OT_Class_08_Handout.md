# Ecclesiastes

## Context

- Who is the “Teacher?”

- Setting within the narrative of salvation history

## Theme

_Meaningful!  Meaningful!  All is meaningful because all is ordered by an eternal, sovereign, and purposeful God.  Therefore, we should fear God and rejoice in what He has given us to do and to have._

## Structure of the Book

## Vanity of Vanities – Ecclesiastes 1:1-2:23

## The Book’s Thesis: Ecclesiastes 2:24-26

> There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God, for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment? For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.

Ecclesiastes 3:12-14; 5:18-20; 8:15; 9:7-10

# 1 & 2 Kings

## Context

- Historical Context

    Compiled during the time of the exile

    To show exile a result of sin; not Yahweh’s unfaithfulness

    Events take place roughly between 970 BC and 560 BC

- Redemptive-Historical Context

    Covenant with David looms large in the background

    What of the promises to Abraham, Israel, and David?

## Theme

_The King, the covenant representative, sometimes obeys the word of Yahweh and the people are blessed, but sometimes rebels against the word of Yahweh and brings calamity upon the people.  Finally, Yahweh’s patience runs out and His people suffer the covenant consequences for their sins.  Yet, through it all, Yahweh is still faithful to the promises He made to David._
