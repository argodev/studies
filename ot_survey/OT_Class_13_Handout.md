# 1st &amp; 2nd Chronicles

Context

Purpose of Chronicles

## I. 1 Chronicles 1-9 Genealogies: The Roots of the Postexilic Community

A focus on the line of promise

A focus on Judah

Inclusion of “all Israel”

To interpret a genealogy (or any text of Scripture), always start with the author’s main point.

## II. 1 Chronicles 10 – 2 Chronicles 9 The United Monarchy: The Messianic Hope of the Postexilic Community

Communicating his point by differences from Samuel & Kings:

1. Chronicles presents a vision of what the Messiah will be like by highlighting only positive aspects of David and Solomon.  

    2 Sam. 11:1-2 v. 1 Chron. 20:1-2

    What happened to Bathsheba and Uriah?

2. In Chronicles, the accounts of David and Solomon revolve around the temple of God.

    1 Kings 5:7 v. 2 Chron. 2:12

    Wisdom for ruling v. wisdom for building

    2 Chron. 6:24-26

## III. 2 Chronicles 10-36 The Kings of Judah: Examples of Rebellion and Repentance for the Postexilic Community

Key to understanding this section: 2 Chron. 7:13-15

A focus on repentance and forgiveness

A focus on “immediate retribution”

- The danger of applying 2 Chron. 7:14 to any nation-state today

- Examples of “immediate retribution:”

- Examples of mercy: 2 Chron. 17:9-10, 32:25-26

- Examples of judgment: 2 Chron. 12:1-2, 25:27

The end of the book: exile and release (2 Chron. 36:15-20)

## Conclusion: Three Ways to Apply Chronicles

1. See how it points to Jesus

2. Learn about living in the “already, not yet”

3. Thank God for absorbing immediate retribution
