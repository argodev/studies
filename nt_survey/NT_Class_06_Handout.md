# Introduction to Paul: The Truths of the Kingdom

Who is Paul?

## Conversion: From Persecutor to Preacher

- Jewish Heritage - Philippians 3:4-6

  - Hebrew of Hebrews

  - As to the law a Pharisee

  - As for zeal, persecuting the church

>>FF Bruce: ‘If Stephen argued, “The new has come; therefore the old must go”, Paul [sic] for his part argued, “The old must stay; therefore the new must go”. Hence the uncompromising rigour with which he threw himself into the work of repression.’[^1]

## Application questions

1. Are we ultimately concerned about God’s glory?

2. To what extent are our lives and decisions driven by the one overarching concern of how we can further the ministry of the gospel?

3. Do we see Paul’s letter’s as a great resource for evaluating ways in which the centrality of the gospel might be displaced in our own lives?
