# Galatians: The Enemies of the Kingdom

## Purpose & Background

## The Author and Date

## Brief Outline

1. Chapter 1-2: Personal – The Preacher of Justification
1. Chapter 3-5:15: Doctrinal – The Principles of Justification
1. Chapters 5:16-6: Practical – The Privileges of Justification

## Major Themes

_Two things to remember:_

### A. Remember that the gospel comes directly from God

"For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel. For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ." (1:11-12).

### B. Remember that we are justified by faith alone in Christ alone

__Key Verse:__  “We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.” (2:15-16)

__Application:__ Use the distinction between law and grace in your evangelism.  No man can perfectly comply with the law, and therefore all are in need of a Savior.

_Two things we must do:_

### C. We must fight for the truth of the gospel

__Application:__ As a congregational church, this means that members have the final responsibility of protecting the church against false teaching.

### D. Protect our Freedom in Christ

“For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.” (5:1)

__Application:__ Are you prone to legalism? Are you counting on your consistent quiet times or your model church membership to earn favor with God?  Or do you call genuine accountability “legalism” because it feels uncomfortable—setting the stage for libertinism?

# James: The Wisdom of the Kingdom

## Introduction

1 Corinthians 1: 18–25

## Purpose

That Christians would apply the Gospel to their lives and thus live wisely and in the fear of the Lord.

## Authorship & Date

## Context & Emphasis

__Romans 3:28__ “For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.”

__James 2:24 __“You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.”

Justification as a declaration vs. demonstration of righteousness

Our faith alone saves us but it is never alone. True faith is always accompanied by good works.

## Structure & Outline

1. Chapter 1: Intro
1. Chapter 2: Wisdom in Generosity
1. Chapters 3-4: Wisdom in Speech
1. Chapter 5: Wisdom in Use of Wealth

## Major Themes

### Harmony between the law and gospel

_Three uses of the Law_

1. First use: to restrain sin (Romans 1-2)

1. Second use: to convict of sin (Galatians 3)

1. Third use: to instruct in wisdom (James)

### Relationship to Matthew 5-7

| 1:5 | 7:7 | 3:12 | 7:16 | 4:13-14 | 6:34 |
| 1:17 | 7:11 | 3:18 | 5:9 | 5:2 | 6:19-20 |
| 1:20 | 5:22 | 4:2-3 | 7:7-8 | 5:9 | 5:22, 7:1 |

| 2:5 | 5:3-5 | 4:8 | 6:22 | 5:12 | 5:34-35 |

### Faithful Submission

The wisdom of God vs. this world (James 3:13-18)

### Practical Obedience

Be doers of God’s word (James 1: 25)

### Three Arenas

Generous Love (James 2:1-16)

Careful Speech (James 3:1-12; 4:1-3, 11-17)

Compassionate Wealth (James 1:9-11, 27; 4:13-17)

## Application

1. Pursue true wisdom

   Are you seeking wisdom from God’s Word?

1. Examine relationships

   Are you showing favoritism to others based upon what they look like, what they do, or their similarities to you?

1. Meditate on James

   Is your faith evidencing itself in good works? Do you have people in your life who can help you grow in this way?
