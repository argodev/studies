2:11-3:13: The Primary Application of the Gospel is Unity

_As a result, God has destroyed the barrier between Jew and Gentile, building them into a single building in which God lives by his Spirit.  This is the mystery of which I am a herald and for which I am now suffering._

1. For the glory of God (3:20-21)

## 4:1-5:2: Build One Another Up

_Keep the unity of the Spirit required by your new lives in Christ; to accomplish this, God has given us gifts to build unity.  So you must no longer live as godless Gentiles.  Instead, speak the truth, building each other up and forgiving just as Christ forgave you._

- Gifts

- Wisdom

- Speech

- Money

## 5:3-14: Do Not Partner with Darkness

_Don’t misunderstand me, however, I am not telling you to have unity with those who lie and say that immorality is okay._

## 5:15-6:9: Make the Most of Every Opportunity

_Instead, make the most of every opportunity, submitting to each other in the following ways: Wives, submit to your husbands; husbands love your wives as Christ did the church.  Children, obey your parents; fathers, bring your children up in the training of the Lord.  Slaves, obey your earthly masters; masters, treat your slaves with respect and fear since you serve the same master._

- Be filled with the Spirit, sing to one another

- Submit to one another

  - Wives submit to your husbands (and husbands love your wives) to image Christ and the church

  - Children submit to your parents (and fathers instruct your children in the Lord)

  - Slaves submit to your masters (and masters treat your slaves with Christ as your master)

## 6:10-23: Stand to the End

_Finally, put on the full armor of God so that you can continue to stand, praying even for me, that I might continue to stand._
