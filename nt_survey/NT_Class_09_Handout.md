## Outline of Hosea

i. Hosea 1:1-3:5 – Hosea’s Adulterous Wife, Gomer
   a. Hosea, Gomer, and Their Children 1:2-2:1
   b. The Lord’s Marriage to Israel 2:2-23

    b. Accusation, Judgment, and Mercy 6:4-11:11
    c. Accusation, Judgment, and Mercy 11:12-14:9

_This threefold structure becomes apparent in the text through some key words.  Phrases like “bring charges,” “rebuke,” “plead with,” and “contend with” begin the **accusations** of sin.  Phrases like “blow the horn,” and “sound the trumpet” show God’s **judgment** against sin.  And phrases like “yet,” “afterward,” and other such transition words, “I will return,” “I will go back,” and “return O Israel” indicate God’s promises of **mercy**._

   a. The Promise of Salvation 2:18-32
   b. The Promise of Justice 3:1-16

_Notice the gospel flow of thought through the book: lamentation over sin followed by repentance from sin results in salvation and a restored relationship with God._
