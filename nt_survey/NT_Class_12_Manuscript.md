# The Enemies of the Kingdom - Legalism: The Book of Galatians

## Introduction

All throughout history, man has been trying to please God through his own works.  It’s built into our natures.  People want to be able to say that their destiny depends on some action of their own doing.  And so man has created all sorts of false religions to provide a system of beliefs through which he can _earn_ reconciliation with God.  

It could be the person who thinks they’ll be saved because they’re a generally good person.  It could be the Roman Catholic who believes that God’s grace cooperates with their own good works to secure justification.  It could be the devout Muslim who thinks that their good works achieve most of what they need to make it to heaven, and that God’s mercy accomplishes the rest.  It could be the person who think that they must be baptized in order to be saved.  Whatever the situation, all these ways of thinking have the same thing in common: we do some, God does some.  And, presumably, in the end we both get credit.

Well, that’s exactly the kind of false belief that Paul is responding in the letter to the Galatians.  The false teachers in the cities of Galatia were perverting the Gospel by adding requirements for salvation, namely circumcision, and Paul with great passion and zeal exhorts the Galatians to recognize this teaching as false.  So, please open you Bibles to Galatians (ask if anyone needs a Bible).   First, a little background.

## Background

### The Region of Galatia and Founding of Churches

Galatia was a Roman province in central Asia Minor (central Turkey).  So unlike some other letters in the New Testament, Galatians was written not to a single church but to a group of churches—all those in the province of Galatia.  Paul most likely planted churches in southern Galatian cities during his first missionary journey (46-48 A.D.).  In particular, we learn in the book of Acts that he planted churches in Pisidian Antioch (13:14-50), Iconium (13:51-14:7), Lystra (14:8-19), and Derbe (14:20, 21).

### The Opposition: The Judaizers[^1]

Well, what happened between the planting of these churches and the writing of this letter?  After Paul left the churches in Galatia, we read in Acts 15:1 that:  "But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, ‘Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.’"

Commonly called "Judaizers," these Jews taught that Gentiles who wanted to become Christians must still follow the law of the Old Testament.  It’s possible that the teachers who came down to Antioch were the same teachers troubling the churches throughout Galatia.  

Now, it does not appear that these false teachers were rejecting Christ out of hand.  In fact, they may have believed that he was the Messiah.  Indeed, there is no indication that Paul tries to correct anyone for saying that Jesus was not the Messiah.  But what they were doing was saying that God’s people must continue to observe the law.  So, according to them, to become a Christian, you must first obey the law, particularly through circumcision.  They were teaching a false Gospel.  Recognize that some false gospels are false because they subtract from the gospel.  You can be a Christian but not believe in the reality of sin, the deity of Christ, and so forth.  But other false gospels are false because they _add_ to the gospel.  They get everything right, but then add in a few additional requirements.  But those “gospels,” as Paul says, are no gospel at all.

Well, in order to convince these churches of their additional requirements, it seems from this letter that these false teachers were attacking the reputation and authority of Paul.  We glean this from some of Paul's comments, and the defense he offers of his ministry in chapters 1 and 2.  It seems that the Judaizers claimed that:  Paul made up "his" gospel, (1:11-12), that he erred with regard to the law, and that Man, not the Lord, gave Paul's authority or apostleship to him (1:1).

The false teachers were motivated by a couple of factors.  First, they wanted to avoid persecution.  Jews, of all people, were exempt under Roman law from submitting to the state religion, so obeying the Jewish law could help a person avoid persecution both by the Jews and the Romans.  And second, they want to boast in themselves – in their own deeds.  Paul warns “It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.” (6:12-13).  

## Purpose of the Letter

And so, the purpose of the letter is clear: To counter the Judaizers' false teachings. Paul writes this letter to the Galatian churches.  And in it, he re-asserts the true gospel of justification by faith alone in Christ alone.  Many of the points that Paul makes here, he makes as well in his letter to the Romans.  So, on the back of the handout, you’ll see a chart summarizing many of the similarities between the two letters.

## Brief Outline

As the ESV Study Bible notes, it is difficult to divide Galatians into neat sections because Paul returns to the same themes throughout the book.  Roughly, he spend the first two chapters on personal matters.  He establishes his credentials as an apostle.  He defends the Gospel he preaches as not of his own invention. He recounts his relationships with the other Apostles, including their recognition of him and his opposition to Peter on one occasion.  His purpose here is to defend against accusations some false teachers were evidently leveling against him and to establish that the Gospel is more important than any individual’s personal authority.

The next two or two-and-a-half chapters are the core theological argument of the book.  Paul tells the Galatians that their reliance on good works for righteousness was exactly counter to the Gospel.  It is tantamount to returning to the Mosaic Law and disregarding Christ’s atoning work.  But the Law given to Moses did not make Israel righteous: instead, it served to illustrate Israel’s inability to live up to God’s standards.  Even Abraham was justified not by works but by faith, Paul writes.  But God through Christ has given us grace that we might be adopted as his sons.  As sons we are free.

The final chapter and a half apply the theological argument to everyday living.  Because we are free we should live lives marked by the Spirit, not by the flesh.  Life according to the flesh is marked by idolatry, immorality, jealousy, etc, but life by the Spirit is marked by love, peace, patience, kindness, and the other fruits of the Spirit.  Paul concludes with a final warning and farewell.

So, at the risk of oversimplification, you can think of the letter in three parts.  The Personal, the Preacher of Justification (that is, Paul) in chapters 1 and 2.  The Doctrinal, the Principle of Justification, from 3:1 through 5:15.  And the Practical, the Privileges of Justification, from 5:16 through the end of chapter 6.

## Major Themes

Well, how does Paul respond to the false teaching, to the accusations against his authority, and to the perversion of the gospel?

Specifically, he gives the reader of Galatians:

_Two things_ to remember, and
_Two things_ to do.

This will form the outline of the rest of our time in Galatians.

### Two Things to Remember

First, let's take a look at the two things Paul encourages us to remember.

#### 1. The Gospel Comes Directly From God

First, Paul refutes the claim that he or any other man invented the gospel or made up core doctrines of the faith to suit their own ends.  Paul makes this point throughout the letter.

__He first re-asserts his apostleship__ – Jesus Christ and God the Father sent him.  He opens the letter by introducing himself and his credentials:  “Paul, an apostle—not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead” (1:1).  As we mentioned earlier, it seems from the tone and comments made in the first two chapters, that the Judaizers were attacking Paul's claim to authentic apostleship.  So, he counters that error from the start – literally from the opening greeting in verse 1.  

__Not only does Paul re-assert his apostleship, He then demonstrates that he received the revelation directly from Jesus Christ.__  “For I would have you know, brothers that the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel. For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelations of Jesus Christ.” He writes in __1:11-12__.  To emphasize this point, Paul reveals his dramatic conversion from persecuting Christians to being persecuted for the sake of Christ.  How ridiculous to think that this is something he made up.  “For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted he church of God violently and tried to destroy it. And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.” __(1:13-17)__.

__Therefore, Paul demonstrates the consistency of his gospel with that taught from the beginning.__  Notice in chapter 2, that Paul had no acquaintance with the Judean church, but that they confirmed that the Gospel Paul was preaching was the same as that taught from the beginning in the early church.  It was the same faith that they already held and the same faith that Paul had previously persecuted.  So, the gospel he preached predated his conversion and his apostleship.  

__Paul then documents that his gospel was the same gospel affirmed and recognized by the Apostles.__  Paul recounts a meeting with the Apostles, which was important because it affirmed the work of God in Paul's ministry and affirmed that the "pillars" of the church – James, Peter, and John – were in agreement with the message Paul delivered to the Gentiles.  Paul records: “On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. “ (2:7-9).  

#### 2. Justification by Faith Alone in Christ Alone

Well, that's the response to the argument that "Paul made up the gospel or invented Christianity."  But what do we say to those who claim that "the gospel is faith plus works"?  That leads us to the second thing we must remember about that the gospel: __Justification is by faith alone in Christ alone__.

This was one of the central issues and principles of the Protestant Reformation.  But hundreds of years before the reformation, Paul makes precisely the same point here.  Paul is very clear in this.  And we see that right at the beginning of the letter.  Look at 1:3:  “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.”

It is Christ alone who has rescued us and saved us, and not because of any merit in us.  Notice one thing here right at the beginning of this letter.  Paul doesn’t begin as he does in his other letters – by pointing out evidences of grace in the lives of his readers or by praising God for them.  No, he gets right to the point.  “I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel –not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.” (1:6-7).  Paul recognizes that the very heart of the Gospel is at stake here.  The debate in the Galatian churches raised questions vitally important questions.  Was the law to be kept in order to be justified?  Were some parts of the law, like circumcision and certain feasts, essential to salvation?

Paul gives a summary answer to that question in 2:15-16.  He writes “We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.”

This may be the key verse in the entire epistle.  We must believe in Jesus Christ alone to be justified.  This passage warns that the law is utterly ineffective for justification.  We should let the last part of verse 16 ring in our ears.  _By observing the law no one will be justified._

To support this argument, Paul wisely calls upon the very person regarded as "the father" of the Judaizers:  Abraham.  And yet he points out that Abraham is the very model of justification by faith alone; not even Abraham was justified by observing the law, but by faith.  He starts by quoting Genesis 15:6, “Just as Abraham ‘believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness’?” He then continues, “Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed.’ So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.” (3:6-9).  

This is set in sharp contrast to the law, which brings a curse on sinners, a curse that Christ alone can bear for us.  “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us –for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree’ –so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.” (3:13-14).

Paul then anticipates the reader's next question.  If this is so... if the law does not impart salvation, "What then is the purpose or value of the law?"  First notice what Paul says that the law was not intended to do.  “Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.” (3:21).  So, the law was not in opposition to the promise of God to Abraham to bless him with a Seed that would bless all nations.  Neither was the law to impart life or righteousness.  Rather, the law was to lead us to Christ.  “So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,” (3:24-25).  Paul teaches us that the law functioned as a stern schoolmaster or tutor, barking at us for our every sin and pointing out to us our desperate need for a Savior.  

Paul then goes on to talk more specifically about what it means to have been justified with God through faith alone in Christ alone.  Paul gives us at least three direct consequences of justification that we should remember.  

First, God adopts us as sons and heirs. “But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.” (4:4-5).  We are no longer slaves but sons.  

Second, God sends His Spirit into our hearts.  “And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father!’” (4:6).  The Spirit will never leave us.

Third, God makes us free.  We are no longer held under the condemnation of the law (more on this in a little while).

### Point of Application

This distinction between law and gospel or grace helps us in our evangelism.  Perhaps you know someone who thinks that their morality is good enough to secure God's salvation.  This view of the law prompts us to ask, "How good is good enough?"  Or, "What do you suppose is God's standard for righteousness and salvation?"  Well, the answer is perfection.  Breaking the least of the commandments is breaking the whole law. [most people will acknowledge that they do not live perfect lives].  We should help people see that perfection is required by God and is well beyond our ability; AND so, we all are in need of the Savior; one who can pay the punishment of all of our sins.  A careful reading of the sermon on the mount—especially Jesus’ call to perfection—is incredibly helpful in these conversations.  “...unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt 5:20b)

So, two things to remember when countering this false teaching – (1) the gospel comes directly from God; and (2) the content of the gospel message is justification is by faith alone in Jesus Christ alone.

[any questions?]

### Two Things To Do

Next, let's consider the two things we are to do if we are to keep the biblical gospel and its effects in full view.  First:

#### 1. Fight for the Truth of the Gospel

Some things are worth fighting for.  The Gospel is clearly worth fighting for.  The apostle's instructions for fighting for the truth might be summarized in three points:

Step 1:  __Do not be persuaded by false teachers to forsake the truth__, rather stand up to those who pervert the gospel.  “But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.” __(1:8-9)__.

Step 2:  __Do not worry about how others think of you.__  Paul recognizes he has opponents, and asks “For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.” __(1:10)__.  Fear of man is a powerful temptation.  Here Paul is saying, don’t fear man, fear God.  

Step 3:  The third aspect of fighting for the Gospel is that we are to __take stands even against leaders and others we respect if they are in serious error where the gospel is concerned.__  This is exactly what Paul did when he found Peter to be in error.  Peter seems to have fallen into this when he separated himself from gentiles because of his fear of man.  “But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, ‘If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?’” __(2:11-14)__.  It’s interesting, you know, that just a few verses ago, in verse 9, Paul describes Peter as one whom God was at work in as an apostle, and one reputed to be a pillar of the church.  And yet, here in verse 14, Paul is recounting how he rebuked Peter because he was in error.

Now, of course, this idea of fighting for the gospel is a dangerous one.  What do we do with it?

### Application

Quite simply, don’t act on your own.  But do act!  For a congregational church like Immanuel, the Galatian letter suggests that ultimately __it is the _membership’s_ responsibility to judge the accuracy of its leaders.__  Remember, that this letter is addressed to the churches, not to a particular church leader or to a group of elders.  Paul is admonishing the members of the church for putting up with these false teachers (and these are young Christians).  Indeed in __1:8__ Paul says that even if he—an apostle!—should come and preach a different gospel than the one they had already accepted, then they should reject him.   Paul assumes that his readers know the gospel, or should, and that they have the ability and responsibility for correcting those who teach false things.  We must prayerfully be prepared to protect the witness of the church and the purity of the gospel by immediately addressing false teaching.

#### 2. Protect our Freedom in Christ.

The second thing Paul's letter encourages us to _do_ is to keep in full view the freedom we have in Christ.  Throughout chapter 4, especially 4:21-31, Paul argues that the law enslaves those who try to obey it.  

But with regard to the gospel, Paul tells us: "For freedom Christ has set us free;” (5:1).  Jesus has set us free from the curse of the law, from sin and its effects, from God's wrath.  And so we are free to serve the true and living God knowing that our attempts at earning God's love or approval are futile and oppressive.  

But having discovered our freedom, how are we to use it?  We are to use our freedom to love others, which ironically, fulfills the law of Christ.  “For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” (5:13-14).  So, with this Paul makes an important point.  Our freedom is not to be consumed on our lusts and sin (antinomianism– opposite of legalism); rather we are free _from_ sin and free to _give_ ourselves to others in love.  

What Paul has been opposing was not _that people were obeying the law_, but that they were insisting that obedience to the law _was required for salvation_.  That’s why Paul can plead with the Galatians not to live as slaves to the law, and then turn around and tell them to do many of the very things required by the law.  The difference is that, _rather than obeying the law with an eye toward earning God’s favor, we as Christians should live consistent with our new nature as children of God, in such a way as to glorify him by our transformed lives_.  We should live holy lives because we cannot help but want to please our saving God.

Thus, faith in Jesus alone for our salvation leads to Spirit-filled living.  We are to grow in the fruits of the Spirit.  “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.” (5:22-25.)

And how do we apply these principles of freedom in our own lives?  By battling both legalism and libertinism as enemies of our freedom in Christ.

I don’t think many of us here are advocating circumcision as necessary for our salvation.  As Christians, we would agree that we are saved by faith in Christ alone.  And yet even as Christians, legalism often creeps into our lives.  So, we should examine ourselves regularly for this.

Do you at times try to become “righteous” before God through your right living, such that you forget that it is only Christ’s righteousness that helps us?  Are you counting on your consistent quiet times or your model church membership over several years to earn favor with God?

Do you have a difficult time accepting God’s grace when you sin, thinking that you must somehow endure punishment for that sin?  These are legalistic ways of thinking that we can fall into.  To counter such thinking, we should continue to preach the Gospel to ourselves, reminding ourselves of Christ’s perfect sacrifice for our sin, past, present and future, and his perfect righteousness which is imputed to us if we believe.  His blood alone paid for us and because of that, now we are secure in Him forever.

But at the same time, just because salvation is by faith, we are not to presume upon God’s grace.  __Are you tempted to turn freedom into permission to sin?__

If so, read these verses again in Galatians 5:13-14

“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”

Or perhaps it’s not to that extreme, but out of a desire to flee legalism, your tendency would be to structure the church such that we are not providing the accountability we need to fight sin.  Yes, we need to be reminded daily of the gospel of grace.  But the moment you start accusing those asking you difficult questions about your life of legalism—presumptively judging their motives to be judgmental—you have done exactly what Paul warns us against.  Probing questions are at times legalistic.  But not necessarily.  And among healthy Christians, not often.  Healthy peer pressure to do Godly things can be interpreted—especially by those who tend to be insecure—as legalistic.  But it is often nothing more than the type of Godly encouragement we see written of in Hebrews.  Especially if you come from a background that was genuinely legalistic, be very careful of pasting the label of “legalism” on everything that feels uncomfortable in this church.  God seems to have created a culture here of being grace-focused gospel-celebrators and also deeply involved in each other’s lives, in ways that sometimes get uncomfortable.  That’s an amazing thing, and we need to work hard to protect both.

[Questions?]

## Conclusion

The Galatian church, and the church today, encounters assaults from the enemies of the kingdom.  In the face of such assaults, we are to keep in full view the __*true gospel of trust in Christ alone*__ and its effects of freedom, love and a Christ-provided righteousness.  We are to contend for the truth of the gospel; resist those who obscure it; and live by the Spirit of God, putting to death the sinful desires of the flesh.

# The Wisdom of the Kingdom: James

Wisdom, from a biblical perspective, is not the mere possession of knowledge but the process of employing knowledge correctly in order to please God. In the Old Testament, God inspired what came to be known as Wisdom literature—the books of Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, and Ecclesiastes—to give his people practical instruction in how to live wisely and in the fear of the Lord. 

At the heart of all Wisdom literature, as at the heart of the entire Old Testament, was the pressing reality of a coming kingdom, a kingdom whose principles and standards were foreshadowed in the admonitions and aphorisms presented in those ancient Wisdom texts.

In the New Testament, as we’ve seen in this course repeatedly, the kingdom foreshadowed in the Old Testament is finally here. The dawning of this new and glorious age begs some important questions for Christians in their pursuit of wisdom. In light of the gospel, has God left us any instruction about how to live wisely? What does wisdom look like this side of Calvary? 

There is nothing quite like the book of Proverbs or Ecclesiastes in the New Testament, let alone a case study of the magnitude of the one found in the Book of Job. Yet there is no question that in the gospel, God has unveiled the ultimate wisdom for his people. As Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 1:22-25

> 22For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, 24but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

This morning, in the hopes of addressing the question of Wisdom in the kingdom of God, we turn to the book of James. Not unlike Old Testament Wisdom literature in structure and tone, the book is also—perhaps more so than any other book in the New Testament—directly informed by Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.

We’ll begin our study with a look at the purpose, background, context, and structure of James before turning to major themes and, in keeping with spirit of the letter, some practical application for our lives.

## Purpose

So, why was the book of James written? To begin with, it was written to encourage Christians after the persecution that began with the stoning of Stephen in __Acts 7–8__. We can see this in the opening verses. “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,” it says in verse 2. The book, however, clearly intends not only to encourage but also to exhort young Christians to pursue wisdom. The author suggests that an essential element, and even a primary means, of persevering in the Christian life is wise living.

Twice, in verse __1:5__ and verses __3:13–18__, the author exhorts his readers to ask for and to demonstrate wisdom. The book teems with example after example of what a life of wisdom entails. But ultimately, such wisdom is summed up in a manner very consistent with what we see in the Old Testament. The book of Proverbs, if you recall, declares, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” The book of James, at its climax in __chapter 4 verses 4-10__, in characteristically blunt yet pastoral language, puts it like this:

> 4 You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 5 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, ‘He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us’? 6 But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, ‘God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’ 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 9 Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

As these verses demonstrate, wisdom in the New Testament, as in the Old, is ultimately an issue of repentance and faith, of turning away from the world and turning to God, through Christ, in humble devotion and faith. James wrote his letter precisely so that Christians would know how to apply the Gospel to their lives in a variety of situations, so that they might indeed live wisely and in the fear of the Lord.

## Authorship & Date

The Book of James takes its title from James, Jesus’ half brother and the man whom most scholars credit with authoring the book. The authority which comes through in the inordinate amount of imperative verbs in the letter matches the authority of James that we see in his speech to the council of elders in Jerusalem in Acts 15:13-21. James, who was also a key leader in the early church in Jerusalem, was martyred in 62 AD, which means he wrote his eponymous letter before then, perhaps even as early as 45 AD, several years before the Jerusalem Council.  The general idea is that if he had written his letter _after_ he met the apostle Paul at the Jerusalem Council, the letter would have more clearly dealt with the way Paul taught about justification.  So it must have been written prior to the Council, which was sometime around 48 AD.  If this is correct, it would make the book of James the oldest book in the New Testament.

## Context & Emphasis

With the Book of James, understanding context is of the utmost importance. We don’t have to read very far into the book before coming across passages that, on the surface at least, appear to contradict other foundational New Testament teachings, particularly regarding the connection between faith and works.

So let’s just get it out there and tackle it: I am thinking specifically of verses such as __James 2:24__, which states: “You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.” Juxtaposing this text against Paul’s teaching in __Romans 3:28__—“For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.”—some theologians in church history, even Martin Luther for a short time, have concluded that James undermines the biblical truth of justification by faith alone.

So, was James off his rocker on this point? Do Paul and James in fact contradict each other? Well, to start, we know that James and Paul accepted one another as fellow believers. In Gal 2:9 James extends the right hand of fellowship to Paul. In Acts 21:18-20 James praises Paul’s ministry. So James and Paul themselves didn’t think they disagreed.  But how do we reconcile the two and be faithful to Scripture? To answer these questions, it is helpful to contrast the divergent yet equally worrisome teachings that prompted Paul and James to write their respective letters.

When Paul uses the word _justified_, he is employing it in a legal sense, as a word that means _being declared not guilty_. In Romans, Paul is addressing the claims of the so-called Judaizers, who taught that God declared people guilty or innocent based upon their actions. Paul counters by arguing that we are justified before God not by the works of our hands, which only ever supply damning evidence of our guilt, but by faith in Jesus Christ and what he has done on our behalf. When Paul uses the word “justification” he is meaning a “declaration of righteousness.”

In Romans, as it were, we are in the courtroom. In James, however, we have moved into the court of public opinion. When James uses the word _justified_, he means a _visible, public vindication of a personal claim- or a "demonstration of righteousness."_ James is countering a common misunderstanding among wealthy Jewish leaders in Jerusalem—perhaps even influenced by a misunderstanding of Paul’s teaching. These hypocrites taught that works were of little-to-no importance so long as people believed the right things. In contrast, James argues that Christian faith is not justified, or vindicated, by hollow orthodoxy, but by works that provide evidence of true faith.  

In short, both James and Paul agree that, to quote Martin Luther, justification is by faith alone by never by faith that is alone.  Instead, it is always accompanied by a life of obedience, love, and the fear of the Lord.

## Structure & Outline

So, with that as the purpose and context for the letter, how does James actually accomplish this?  Deceptively short, the Book of James wastes few words. In five concise chapters, the author packs in more than 50 imperative verbs, a literary device that gives the writing a force disproportionate to its relative brevity. As in the book of Proverbs, the material is often presented in the form of pithy sayings grouped around particular themes. Many of these sayings, or aphorisms, carry the residue of Jesus’ teachings in the gospels. For this reason, some scholars have characterized James as a kind of Cliff’s Notes to, or greatest-hits album of, Jesus’ core teachings. Although it can have a “collected sayings” feel to it, the letter nevertheless follows a loose structure, which we can outline, roughly, as follows:

| | |
|--|-------|
| Chapter 1 | Introduction of major arenas: Wisdom is displayed through testing __(1:2-5)__, and specifically in 3 arenas of life: generosity __(1:27)__, speech __(1:19-26)__, and attitude towards money __(1:9-11)__.  We then spend the rest of the letter stepping through each of these individually. |
| Chapter 2 | First, testing through generosity: Favoritism is forbidden __(2:1-15)__, which leads to a discussion of faith and deeds. |
| Chapters 3-4 | Second, testing through speech: Taming the tongue __(3:1-12)__, prayer __(4:1-3)__, slander and boasting __(4:11-17)__ |
| Chapter 5 | And finally, testing through our attitude toward wealth __(1:1-6)__, followed by a summary and a conclusion __(5:7-20)__ |

## Major Themes

But James has some common things to say about wisdom displayed in each of these three arenas of life (that is, generosity, speech, and money), just like we see some common themes across all the varied topics in the book of Proverbs.  For the rest of the class today, we’ll look at three of these themes and how they play out in all three of the arenas of life featured in the book of James.  A) the harmony between the law and the gospel, B) faithful submission to God as the means to a blessed life, and C) practical obedience. Let’s take some time to unpack each of these themes, starting with harmony between the law and the gospel.

### A. Harmony between the law and the gospel

Although less explicit than the other themes in the book of James, the harmony between the Old Testament and the New, between the law and the gospel, is the backdrop against which the entire book is written, and forms the basis for how wisdom is to be displayed in the three arenas of life James deals with: generosity, speech, and wealth.

In the Bible, the law has three intended uses. The first use of the law is to restrain sin and provide for a civil society. This is law in the sense that Paul writes of it in __Romans 1 and 2__. The second use of the law, which Paul writes of in __Galatians 3__, is to convict people of their sins and lead them to Christ.  You see this also in the Sermon on the Mount.  As Jesus says, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of God.  Impossible, you say!  Exactly the point.  Jesus’ explanation of the law is intended to drive us to the cross by proving to us that we cannot possibly be good enough for God in our own strength.

But there is a third use of the law, the one that James is most concerned with, and that is the law as a guide for how Christians should live in light of the gospel.  Going back to the sermon on the mount, for example, once we have been driven to the cross, and have accepted Christ’s righteousness lived on our behalf, we can now go back to that sermon and find incredible wisdom for how we should live the Christian life.  Even as Christians, imperative verbs are important.  And that’s what we see here in James.  The third use of the law.  Now, this distinction is important to understand as we read the imperatives James gives to his readers. As we’ve already discussed, James is not commanding his readers to work for their salvation but rather to show they are saved by their good works. This kind of living is not arbitrary moralism but evidence that we have found wisdom in the gospel, that we are living in the fear of the Lord.

Christ often spoke about the law in this way, and as we previously mentioned, the book of James is heavily dependent of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount as he goes about instructing us on how we should live now that God’s kingdom has come. In your handout, you’ll see a chart that shows different passages in James alongside Jesus’ teaching in the Sermon on the Mount as recounted in the gospel of Matthew. I’ll read the first few of these, and leave the rest for your personal reference.

| | James | | Matthew |
|--|------|--|------|
| 1:2 | Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds  | 5:11f. | Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. |
| 1:4 | And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. | 5:48 | You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. |
| 1:5 | If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. | 7:7 | Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. |
| 1:17 | Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. | 7:11 | If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! |
| 1:20 | For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. | 5:22 | But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, “You fool!” will be liable to the hell of fire. |
| 1:22-24 | But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. | 7:24-26 | “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on a rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on the house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. |
| 2:5 | Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? | 5:3-5 | “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” |
| 2:10-11 | For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it. For he who said, “Do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.” | 5:19-22 | Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, “You fool!” will be liable to the hell of fire. |
| 2:13 | For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. | 5:7 | Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. |
| 3:12 | Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water. | 7:16 | You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? |
| 3:18 | And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. | 5:9 | Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God |
| 4:2-3 | You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. | 7:7-8 | Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knowck, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. |
| 4:4 | You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. | 6:24 | No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and espies the other. You cannot serve God and money. |
| 4:8 | Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners and purify your hearts, you double-minded. | 6:22 | The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, |
| 4:9 | Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. | 5:4 | Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. |
| 4:11-12 | Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor? | 7:1 | Judge not, that you be not judged. |
| 4:13-14 | Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit” –Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. | 6:34 | Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. |
| 5:2 | Your riches have rotted and your garments are motheaten. | 6:19-20 | Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. |
| 5:9 | Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door. | 5:22, 7:1 | But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, “You fool!” will be liable to the hell of fire. ; Judge not, that you be not judged. |
| 5:10 | As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. | 5:11-12 | Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. |
| 5:12 | But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation. | 5:34-35 | But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. |

### B. Faithful submission

Let’s turn now to the second theme of James, faithful submission to God. William Dumbrell, an Old Testament scholar, has remarked, “[M]eaning in life cannot be understood within the human compass, but only within the framework of a vision of God.” If you have ever grappled with the problems of suffering and evil, or the seeming injustices of this world, you know the truth of those words. Nothing in our world finally makes sense apart from a proper fear and reverence for the God who made, sustains and redeems our world.

According to the book of James, the path to a blessed life in the kingdom begins, first and foremost, with submission to the Lord and to what he says about the world. Any wisdom that has anything else as its starting point is foolishness. In __James 3:13-18__, we read of the stark contrasts between the so-called “wisdom” of this world and the wisdom of God:

> Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. For where Jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

The wisdom of the world, as this passage makes patently clear, stands in direct opposition to the wisdom that comes down from heaven. In fact, blind or willful adherence to the world’s wisdom is more than mere foolishness—it is an affront against the Lord. “Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world,” we read in __James 4:4__, “becomes an enemy of God.” So, James calls us, bluntly yet lovingly, to “Humble [o]urselves before the Lord,” and he bookends this command with a sweet promise. If you do this, the verse continues, “He will exalt you.”

And so this motivates action.  As we read in 4:17, “whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.” Simple, but powerful as a principle to combat apathy and procrastination.  Good must be done today.  Not tomorrow.

### C. Practical obedience

A final theme native to the book of James is practical obedience. The author spends most of his time here. To James, obedience to God’s word in our daily lives is the ultimate display of wisdom. “But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.” as it says in __James 1:25__. True blessing, according to James, proceeds from applying God’s word directly to our lives.

Far from a passive enterprise, Christianity is actually an active process of continually heeding God’s word as we hear it preached in community and meditate on it in our quiet times. Christianity is more than just a belief system; it is also a way of life—a faith with implications on how we think and act. Christians, James concludes, are to be doers of God’s word.

As the book of James progresses, the author tethers this overarching admonition that Christians should be doers of God’s word to some specific areas of life:

#### Generous Love

__James 2:1-16__, for instance, entreats Christians to __love others generously__. In these verses, we learn that there was a temptation among the churches to whom James was writing to show favoritism to people based upon worldly prestige, and so James calls them back to the kind of undiscriminating and merciful love that Christ has displayed towards them in the gospel. He commands in __2:12-13__: “So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.” To show favoritism is to forget that we have been shown grace by God, grace that we, an unfaithful band of sinners, did not deserve to receive from a holy God. The fact that we have received such mercy in Christ should compel us to show love and mercy towards others.

#### Careful Speech

In __James 3:1-12__ and then in __James 4:1–3__ and __11-17__, James gives instruction concerning __speech__, the way we use our tongues toward God and others. "With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God..." it says in __3:9-10__, and continues, “My brothers, these things ought not to be so.” The language in these verses is poetic and leavened with some potent metaphors. James compares the human tongue to, among other things, a tiny spark that can nevertheless engulf a mighty forest in flames.

A loose tongue, to James, reveals a lack of self-control, and a lack of self-control reveals a void of reverence and submission towards God. Indeed, an untamed tongue reveals a fundamental lack of wisdom and invites judgment from God instead of blessing. What comes out of our mouths—whether slander or praise, gossip or words of encouragement, silence or prayer—bears testimony about the condition of our hearts. For that reason, James entreats Christians to tame their tongues and take speech seriously.

Incidentally, as regards the most difficult decisions we face in our speech—when we are in relational conflict—James has some profound insight for us.  Chapter 4, verse 1.  “What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?” As you understand it, that little gem of a thought can completely transform your relationships in this world.  Fights and quarrels don’t come, James says, because of something the other person did, or because you had a bad day, or you’re tired, or your personalities don’t click.  Fights and quarrels come from desires that battle within you.  Verse 2: “You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.” Paul Tripp’s book, “War of Words” is a great resource to help you understand the profound implications of this little verse on your life.

#### Compassionate Wealth

Throughout the book, James also cautions his readers about wealth. In __1:9-11__, by comparing a rich man to a wild flower that has no sooner bloomed than withered in the field, he reminds us that worldly riches are ultimately fleeting. Later, in __James 4:13-14__, he warns against the pride and boasting that often erupts from the fount of worldly success: “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit’ –yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life?”

But we know that wealth in and of itself is not sinful: Jesus himself calls Zacchaeus, a wealthy tax collector, ‘son of Abraham’ in Luke 19:9. In 1:10, James calls rich believers “to take pride in his low position.” But lest we think James is calling Christians to avoid wealth entirely, to take up a vow of poverty, he gives some positive examples of how to handle money appropriately, namely by using it to bless others, instead of hoarding it for ourselves. “Religion,” it says in __James 1:27__, that God our Father will “visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.” Because we have been so richly blessed in Christ, we are called, and freed, to use the wealth that we do have to bless others.

## Application

So, what does wisdom look like in the Kingdom of God? Well, the life of wisdom, according to the book of James, is a life lived in submission to God, a life of faith evidenced by works. Hopefully, as we’ve covered topics like applying the law to our lives, faithful submission, practical obedience, careful speech, and compassionate wealth love, you’ve been encouraged and challenged in different areas of your life. I wonder, which of these is the hardest for you? 

Let’s conclude with a few more points of application.. We could come up with dozens, but here are three I’d like to leave us with:

### 1. Pursue true wisdom

If you are tempted, as I often am, to look to this world for wisdom as opposed to God’s word, let James be both a warning and an encouragement to you. The wisdom that leads to a blessed life comes only from God and his Word. Let God’s Word be the roadmap for your life. “Humble yourself,” as James commands, “and he will exalt you.”

### 2. Examine your relationships

James’ admonition to avoid favoritism should cause us to examine, among other things, our relationships and social interactions. Who are your friends and the people you often find yourself gravitating towards and reaching out to? Are they people who dress a certain way? People who have a certain type of job? People with interests that line-up, line by line, with ours? Or are we loving people indiscriminately, mindful of how God has loved us in Christ?

### 3. Commit to meditating on James

Hold James’ definition of Christian faith—a faith that produces good works—up to your life like a mirror and respond accordingly. Ask a friend about what fruit they have seen in your life in the past few months, especially in regards to the way you speak, handle money, and serve others. Ask them to help you brainstorm ways to grow in glorifying God in those areas. There are passages in James, which if taken to heart, can change our lives and relationships, so we should spend time reading it, meditating on it, even memorizing verses from it.
