# New Testament Overview

This is my attempt at adapting the 26-week course by Capitol Hill Baptist Church into a 12-week course for use by our
church congregation. Most of the material here was written by them and, should you be interested, you should
consider the [original materials available on their website](http://www.capitolhillbaptist.org/resources/core-seminars/series/new-testament-overview/).
