# 2 Thessalonians

## Introduction, Background and Purpose

How many of you would say you had a good day yesterday?  (Show of hands.)  How many of you were tempted to think that that meant Jesus came back yesterday?  (Show of hands.)  Well, as odd as it might seem, that’s pretty much the problem going on in the church at Thessalonica that prompted Paul’s second letter to them.  But as removed as that problem seems to be from our situation, I think as we uncover _why_ it was a problem, we’ll discover a good bit of similarity to our own day and time.

Last week we looked at Paul’s first letter to the church at Thessalonica.  He had had the privilege of seeing it established but had to make an abrupt departure due to an onset of persecution.  And so he had written to address some confusion that stemmed from the church not really internalizing some basic truths of the faith—like the second coming of Christ.  Well, some time has passed and things are still a bit of a mixed bag for the Thessalonian Christians.  On the one hand, they are persevering admirably through some difficult persecution.  As Paul writes in 2 Thessalonians 1, _“4Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring. 5This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering”_ (1:4-5).  This was a noble church undergoing suffering, and enduring in a way you or I would most certainly find challenging. But on the other hand, the church was still theologically confused and misunderstood the nature, timing, and purpose of Christ’s return.  And so Paul writes them another short letter to help address some of these problems and to encourage them in perseverance.

## Outline and Structure

So then, let’s get into this letter.  The outline of 2 Thessalonians is pretty straight forward.  After an introduction in the first two verses, Paul turns to a section of thanksgiving and comfort for the persecuted church at Thessalonica. (1:3-12).  Verse 11 sums things up well: _“11To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power”_ (1:11).

And then he gets down to business in chapter 2, refuting false claims about the day of the Lord.  Chapter 3 opens with a transitioning section, verses 1-5, where Paul asks for prayer himself.  And then, verses 6-15, he continues his earlier instruction about Christ’s return, addressing a particular outgrowth of the Thessalonians’ bad theology: their decision to stop working in order to wait for the second coming.  Verses 16-18 of chapter 3 close the letter in Paul’s classic style: _“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.”_ (3:18)

Well.  What all is contained within these three chapters?  We’ll start by thinking through the problem Paul is addressing in the Thessalonian church.  From there we’ll use Paul’s letter to understand why they fell into this error, and finally we’ll look at what we can take away from this controversy ourselves.  First, the problem.

## What was the Thessalonians’ problem?

### The Problem

The problem that caused Paul to write this letter was, simply put, __idleness__.  As Paul writes:

_“6Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep way from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us. 7For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you, 8nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you. 9It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate. 10For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat. 11For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies. 12Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.”_ (3:6-12)

Consider Paul’s seemingly meaningless act of purchasing his own food, of handing over coins to a merchant for something to eat. In that one action, Paul (1) pays for his food, (2) cares for the Thessalonian church by not being a burden, and (3) sets an example. In other words, even small actions that seem insignificant have tremendous meaning when rightly considered.

### The Cause

OK. So a problem of idleness.  Why?  Because the Thessalonians mistakenly thought Jesus had already come back.  Beginning of chapter 2: 

_“1Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, 2not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 3Let no one deceive you in any way.”_ (2:1-3).

Now that seems strange, doesn’t it!  You could understand why they might stop working if Jesus is coming back tomorrow.  But the error in view here is one that suggested “the day of the Lord has already come.”  How could a persecuted people possibly think that Jesus had already come back?  Quite possibly, what was going on here was a group of people who interpreted persecution as, to quote Jesus, “the beginning of birth pains”—events that would occur just prior to his coming.  At least the beginning of the end has come, they thought; so they could give up daily labor.  Still kind of a sketchy theological premise.  But likely behind this is just a reality of human nature.  If we can grab a theological reason to not work, then all the better. Bad theology can be used to justify what people want to do anyway. This idleness was probably caused, in other words, by a combination of their own nature and their misunderstanding of the truth.

### The Solution

So.  What solution does Paul propose? His answer is two-fold: knowledge and obedience. Know the truth, and live it out.

Know the Truth. Paul begins by teaching the Thessalonians the truth about Christ’s return. You see this in the first two chapters. The main thing he wants to be sure they know is that Christ has not yet come back. As we saw at the beginning of chapter 2, he tells them not to be deceived by those who say he has.  But there is more they must understand.

Paul wants to clarify several things about the second coming.  First, when Christ returns, we will all know it.  There will be no confusion or doubt.  It will be the most obvious and clear thing in all of human history.  The Thessalonians do not have to worry that they’d missed it, or that it had already happened, or that they needed to work hard to figure out when it might happen.  Second, before Christ returns there will be persecution led by someone Paul calls “the man of lawlessness.”  And third, Christians already know in advance that Christ will defeat the man of lawlessness, judge persecutors, and vindicate his people.  The Thessalonians should look forward to Christ’s return not with anxiety but with hope and assurance.  Let’s take those three in turn.

First, Christ’s return will be clear.  Paul teaches the clarity of Christ’s return in his first letter to the Thessalonians, as we discussed last week.  Paul wrote in that first letter that “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God.” (4:16).  He reiterates this teaching here.  In Chapter 1 Paul describes the day of Christ’s return as the day “when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,” (1:7) and a day when Christ will be “marveled at among all those who have believed,” (1:10).  Discerning whether Christ has really returned will not be hard at all.  We will “marvel” at the “loud command,” the “voice of the archangel,” the “trumpet call,” the “blazing fire,” the “powerful angels,” and, most of all, at Christ himself.  Whether these are metaphorical images or literal descriptions, Paul’s language makes clear that Christ’s return will be obvious because it will be unlike anything that has ever happened before, including his first coming.  He’ll make it clear for us.  

Second, Christ’s return will be preceded by persecution, and that persecution will be led by someone Paul calls the “man of lawlessness.”  Chapter 2, verse 3: Christ’s return “will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,” Who is this lawless one? Is it some world leader whose name we know? Paul doesn’t say. He does describe him though. Verse 4: He “who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he may be revealed in his time.” He will also deceive others: “The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing,” (2:9-10a). 

But, third, Christ will overthrow the man of lawlessness when he returns.  Paul does not warn the Thessalonians about the man of lawlessness in order to worry them, but to reassure them.  The appearance of persecution and evil is to be expected.  It is not a surprise to God and it is not a sign of God’s weakness or Satan’s strength.  Recall how Paul introduced the man of lawlessness back in 2:3:  he is “the son of destruction.” The man of lawlessness and his persecutors have already failed; God has already defeated them.  Paul adds in verse 6: “And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.  And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.” (2:6-8).  Paul doesn’t talk about the man of lawlessness without mentioning, in the same sentence, that he is doomed and defeated.  Hope, not anxiety, should be our posture toward the future.

__Obey the Truth__. So that’s what we’re to know.  Now, with that knowledge in hand, Christians are called to be obedient to the truth. Back to the problem at hand, they must follow God’s call to work. Amazing, isn’t it, how we go from something as mystifying as the man of lawlessness to something as prosaic as work.  But they’re all connected.  Paul writes, chapter 3 verse 6, “Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.” And then, “Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.” (3:12). In other words, get back to work. “As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.” (3:13-15). This matter is that serious.  Obedience is not optional.

The Thessalonians were idle because they thought the end had come. Paul tells them that Christ has not already returned, and what they must do now is simple: get back to work.  That brings us to our next major question for this morning:

## How did the Thessalonians fall into this problem?

Because let’s be honest here.  It’s not entirely clear how the Thessalonians could possibly have made the mistake of thinking the Lord had come back.  Can you imagine having made that mistake this past week? “Thursday was a really good day. Maybe that’s because Jesus came back!” I don’t think so. Not if you have been instructed as a Christian.

But we shouldn’t think this was all simply a matter of human misunderstanding.  One of the crucial things we need to understand in this little letter is all the language about a relationship with God. The Thessalonians had a relationship with God, but didn’t understand it fully.  I think if we notice God’s role in the letter, we will understand better how this misunderstanding could have happened.  The Thessalonians misunderstood their relationship with God.

__Our relationship with God in the present.__  Notice in chapter 3 the little phrase, “The Lord be with you all” (v. 16). This is a simple phrase of blessing, or what some call a “wish prayer.” Yet consider what the prayer is: it is a prayer for God to bless the church by accompanying them with his presence. Not only that, notice what Paul promises God will do: “He will establish you and guard you against the evil one.” (3:3). So God is with them; he strengthens them; and he protects them. Does that sound like a relationship? 

Paul uses explicit language elsewhere about “knowing God.”  Both Paul and these Thessalonians have come to know God, and they have been given eternal life. That is why Paul can write so openly about being loved by God. In chapter 3, Paul refers to the “love of God” (v. 5). A few verses before, he specifically addresses them, “You, brothers beloved by the Lord” (2:13). And then he speaks of “God our Father, who loved us” (2:16). It’s pretty clear they have a relationship with God.

Perhaps we can perceive Paul and the Thessalonians’ relationship with God most clearly in the language of prayer scattered throughout the letter. And we see this in three ways: Paul thanks God, he makes requests of God, and he asks the Thessalonians to pray for him.

First, Paul thanks God for the Thessalonians’ faith, hope, and love. He writes at the beginning of the letter, “We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.” (1:3).  A little later, Paul thanks God for God’s own love for the Thessalonians and how this love has been realized—in their salvation. In chapter 2, verses 13-14, Paul writes, “But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth. To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Paul is very specific about how God has loved Christians. He has shown his love in election, calling, salvation, sanctification, and glorification. Or, to use less theological language, God has shown us his love by calling us, inclining us, saving us, making us holy, and finally, bringing us home to be with him and like him. Paul thanks God for all these things.

Second, Paul asks God to bless the lives of the Thessalonians. At the very beginning of the letter, he writes, “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (1:2). Then at the very end of the letter, he writes, “Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all . . . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.” (3:16,18). Coming from Paul, these traditional Hebrew (peace) and Greek (grace) greetings are more than mere wish prayers. He invests them with theological meaning—that God would continue to sustain them in his undeserved favor, and that he would hold them in a reconciled state of peace with him and those around them.

- Paul prays for God’s direction to love and perseverance. He writes, “May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.” (3:5). The ultimate direction a Christian needs is direction into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance. Paul knows the Thessalonians’ love would have to endure through difficult circumstances.

- Paul prays for God’s strength. Paul writes, “Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father... comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.” (2:16a,17). God’s encouragement and strength are not given indiscriminately. They have a purpose: to build us up in Christ-glorifying deeds and words.

- And Paul prays for the success of the saints: “To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (1:11-12). Paul wants them to be immediately successful: that God would fulfill their “every good purpose” and their “every act prompted by faith.” And he wants them to be ultimately successful: that the Lord Jesus would “be glorified” in them, and they in him.

__Our relationship with God in the future__.  So all that concerns the Thessalonians’ present relationship with God.  But the big thing the Thessalonians needed to hear—and that we need to hear—is that far more lies ahead, more than any of us has ever experienced.

First, Christ will sit in judgment. Paul writes, “since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.” (1:6-8). Talk about an amazing idea: Christ will come back to sit in judgment and to punish. Judgment and punishment may not be popular concepts today, but they are hardwired into Christianity. Who will he punish? Those who have troubled Christians (v. 6), as well as those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel (v. 8). In chapter 2, Paul promises that God will also punish all “who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness” (v. 12).

How will he punish them? Paul speaks of “vengeance” (1:8) and “condemnation” (2:12). He says God will “repay with affliction those who afflict you,” (1:6). (Vengeance is wrong for us, but the Bible teaches the Lord himself must exercise vengeance in order to remain just.) He also speaks about “eternal destruction” (1:9). The idea here is of a ruin that never ends. What is that ruin like? The great Italian author Dante presented it as coldness. He pictured Satan in hell frozen in the middle of ice. Others have presented it as a ravenous vacuum that can never be filled. Both ideas might have some justification according to this image in 1:9. Clearly, it bespeaks being shut out from the presence of the Lord and the majesty of his power.

Second, Christ will save his own people. That is really what Paul describes in chapter 1, even though he uses different phrases to describe it. When Christ comes, Paul says, “when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.” (1:10). What distinguishes Christ’s own people from the others? Belief, faith, trust, reliance. It is not our superior moral virtue; it is the recognition of our sinfulness before God. We have done things that God says are wrong. Though we act like it, we are not the lords of our own universe. And one day we will have to give account to him. When we do, our only hope is to trust what God has done in Christ. We must trust that Christ himself lived a perfect life and died on the cross for the sins of everyone who repents of his or her sin and turns to Christ. We trust that God has accepted Christ’s sacrifice.

What do we Christians still have to look forward to? What will Christ accomplish at his return? God will gather his own people to himself (2:1). God will count the Christians as worthy of his kingdom (1:5). God will give relief to Christians who are troubled (1:7).

So, how could the Thessalonians have believed Christ had already returned? The relational language in this letter shows us the Thessalonians had a deep and real relationship with God, but it was something radically different than anything they had known as non-Christians and they evidently didn’t fully understand the difference. The character of the relationship, as Paul describes it in this letter, was to help them, and us, understand what they—and we—look forward to as Christians.

Last question, then:

## What can we learn from the Thessalonians?

It would seem that here in DC, we struggle with the exact opposite problem from the Thessalonians.  We are certainly not idle.  And instead of believing Jesus has already returned we have probably become so inured to his tarrying that we functionally behave as if he will never come, at least not in our lifetimes.  

But it is important to realize that while we are not idle in our busy careers, we may still be spiritually idle.  Never assume that because you are busy, you are not lazy.  Do we diligently study God’s word?  Do we deliberately pursue fellowship and mentorship?  Do we organize our finances, our time, and our relationships with God’s ends in view, or our own?  And if we in fact behave as if the Lord will not return anytime soon, then we are almost certainly going to fall into this kind of spiritual idleness.  Why study God’s word if I have decades yet until I meet the Lord upon my death?  Why pursue fellowship now, when I can work hard, earn money, retire early, and fellowship at length then?

So we can end up having just a skewed a view of work, life, time, and priorities as the Thessalonians did.  They believed Christ had already returned and so had fallen into idleness and laxity.  We act as if Christ will never return, and so fall into a very similar pattern of laziness.  The message of 2 Thessalonians is that we should understand that Jesus is coming back, that he is coming back soon, and that we need order our lives in light of that truth.  

What does that look like?  Let’s conclude by highlighting three things.

__We Should Work__.  One thing we can clearly take from this letter is that we should work. Created in the image of God, we were made to work.  Remember, work is not a result of the Fall and sin. Throughout the Bible, God calls people to work and gifts them for that work. God designed work to be the means by which we imitate his own creativeness. It has significance itself, and gives significance to our lives. Not working is regarded as a type of fast done for religious purposes. So the Sabbath is a weekly fast from purposive work (e.g. Ex 33:12). Idleness and sluggishness, on the other hand, are regularly derided in Proverbs and elsewhere.[^1]

I wonder if you feel like work is merely a burden—not your particular job right now, but work itself. If you do, Paul would challenge you to reconsider what work is. Work is a normal, God-given part of human life, including a Christian’s life.

__We Should Live Wisely__.  This letter also teaches us that we should live wisely. The Thessalonians erred in their lives because they erred in their understanding. They thought wrongly and so they lived wrongly. Theology is not unrelated to life. What we understand to be the truth impacts how we live.  Living wisely, then, requires a right understanding of God’s Word. As Paul exhorts the Thessalonians to recall the teaching he had given when he was among them, so we must recall the teaching God has inspired in his Word.

__We Should Live Waiting__.  We should spend every day of our lives waiting—eagerly and expectantly—for Christ’s coming return. The Thessalonians had forgotten this.

I know it is unlikely anyone hearing this core seminar has stopped working because he or she thought the Lord has returned. Yet there is a similarity between the Thessalonians’ situation and our own. These ancient Christians were not working because they thought they had it all. They thought they had reached the pinnacle of the faith. The Lord had returned, and they already had everything Christ would give. That is how they were deceived.  We are deceived like the Thessalonians when we think and live like we already have everything Christianity offers. And when we think and live as if the great summation has already come, either a wrong liberty (doing things we should not do) or a wrong complacency (leaving undone the things we should do) always follows. In the Thessalonians’ case, complacency followed.

Unfortunately, many of us have stopped waiting, just like the Thessalonian Christians.  And when that happens, our faith in the next life slips into faith in this one. Striving for spiritual health is replaced by striving for good stewardship of our physical bodies. Visions of God are replaced by visions of our earthly future, or our children’s future. The hope of heaven is replaced by the hope of the good life. Desire for our Creator God is replaced by desires for creatures.  Unbelief can creep in and gain the upper hand so easily. One begins by believing in this age, as well as the next. Concentrating on this age, rather than the next. Being concerned with this age, instead of the next. Thinking less of the next. De-emphasizing the next. Questioning the next. Ignoring the next. Forgetting the next. Eventually denying the next.

As Christians we no longer live for the fulfillment of our desires here and now. We live instead working and laboring honorably. We give ourselves to caring for others even at a great personal cost, because this life no longer has to bear the weight of all our hopes, desires, and expectations. Without the certainty of Christ’s return, it is not at all certain we can live as Paul exhorts us in this little letter.

# Revelation

Hope is an incredibly powerful thing.What we hope in demonstrates what we value;it drives our perseverance, it motivates our acts of love, and  it gives meaning to our pursuit of purity and holiness.

Our attention this morning turns to the book of Revelation, a book that points ahead to the hope of God’s people: Christ’s final reign.

I wonder what images come to mind when you think of this last book of the Bible? Does the strange imagery tend to scare you off? Maybe you feel like it’s a book about gloom and doom and final judgment. Maybe you’ve spent time in the past picking through its details to discern exactly how the future will play out. Well, no matter your past impressions of this book, let me encourage you to revisit it today with a fresh look. Make no mistake, this book _does_ tell us plenty about the future. But its primary application isn’t in the future—like a map I might give you for a place you’re not going to for another ten years. Instead, its main message is about how we can rightly order our hopes—and thus our lives—today. This marvelous book tells us that, ultimately, God wins. And those who have placed their trust in Him will live with Him forever.

And that’s important. Because if you see this book as being about determining who exactly the Antichrist is, or what exactly the mark of the beast will look like, I suspect Revelation will not change your life very much tomorrow. But as you begin to understand to true message of the book, you can’t help but be changed. How you can live a life today that only makes sense if this book is true? 

## Background

We’ll start with some background. By the time John wrote the book of Revelation from exile on the isle of Patmos around the end of the first century, the gospel had been preached throughout the whole province of Asia as well as much of the rest of the Roman Empire—to the point that Paul could write in Colossians 1:6 that the gospel was bearing fruit “all over the world.”  Many had believed and had become Christians. And those who believed knew that before he was taken up into heaven, Jesus promised that he would one day return and establish God’s final kingdom.

But nothing happened. Instead, wickedness in the empire continued to increase and the little band of Christians began to be persecuted. At the end of the first century, Domitian became the emperor of Rome. Unlike his predecessors who were mostly worshiped as divine after they died, Domitian honestly believed himself to be divine and strongly enforced emperor worship throughout the empire. Because Christians refused to worship anyone but the true God, they found themselves the objects of suspicion and persecution, sometimes even to death. So it led many to question what had happened to God’s good promises. Why did it appear that evil was triumphing over good? Would the church survive? Does God care about us? Can he do anything about our suffering? And if he can, when will he? I wonder, have you ever asked similar questions?

In that context, the book of Revelation was written to encourage Christians toward perseverance and hope.

## Genre

So then, how exactly did God’s Holy Spirit communicate that hope?  That brings us to a discussion of genre. We’ve not spent much time considering genre in this class because the books we’ve studied recently have all been letters, which is a genre we understand quite well. Revelation is different, though. Yes, John writes to seven churches, so it is a letter. But it’s also apocalyptic in nature. And many cases of misunderstanding in this letter stem from a misunderstanding of this genre. What would happen if you played soccer according the rules of football?  It wouldn’t work so well, would it?  It’s the same when you read a piece of literature, biblical or otherwise. You need to understand the rules of the genre or you’ll end up grossly misinterpreting it. So, what does it mean for Revelation to be apocalyptic?

Apocalypse is a Greek word meaning to unveil. It was written not to confuse or to mystify, but rather to serve as a clear unveiling of God’s plan to bring judgment on the wicked and to preserve his people for eternal life in his kingdom. Apocalyptic literature is a kind of prophetic literature, talking about what will happen in the future.

What appears to modern readers as strange visions and coded language was to the first century Jew or Christian a familiar set of literary devices, many of which were drawn from the Old Testament. But while predictive prophecy in the OT generally uses realistic language, apocalyptic uses a symbolic, highly stylized vocabulary to talk about events, both past, present and future. What that means is Revelation is to be interpreted figuratively unless the context forces us to interpret it literally!  Very different than other genres in Scripture.

The events in Revelation are real—but described in apocalyptic, or symbolic terms, rather than as a realistic, linear historical narrative. Throughout the book images are layered over each other, with common themes recapitulated over and over again to give us a set of strong impressions. In this case, the strong impression that God is in control, that he wins in the end, and that he cares deeply for his people.[^2]

## Outline

Now. With genre in view, let’s move into the structure of the book. One of the most important things to recognize about the structure of Revelation is that it is divided into seven separate sections that do not follow after each other chronologically and linearly, but rather recapitulate one another and build in intensity in a sort of progressive parallelism. In terms of history, each section begins with the first coming of Christ and ends with his second coming, thus covering the entire church age. The last few sections build further, ending with the final judgment and the new heaven and earth.

| | __The Church and the World__ |
|---|------------|
| Chapters 1-3 | The Church in the World (Seven Lampstands) |
| | Each church is a type of response to the world. There are references to 2nd coming throughout, but no formal progression to final judgment |
| Chapters 4-7 | The Church suffering trial and persecution (Seven Seals) |
| | 6th seal a picture of final judgment, while the 7th seal is silence, which in OT is symbolic of the shut mouths of the ungodly awaiting judgment. |
| Chapters 8-11 | The Church protected and victorious (Seven Trumpets) |
| | Visions of God’s judgment on the world, including unbelievers in the church. 7th trumpet a declaration of final victory! God wins! |

| | __Christ and the Dragon__ |
|---|------------|
| Chapters 12-14 | Christ opposed by the Dragon & his helpers (Seven Visions) |
| | Begins with the birth of Christ and ends with scenes of final judgment. Rev. 14:14. |
| Chapters 15-16 | Final judgment upon the wicked (Seven Bowls) |
| | Again, section ends with final judgment: “It is done!” Rev. 16:17. |
| Chapters 17-19 | The Fall of Babylon and the Beasts |
| | This section progresses even further, past the final judgment of Babylon and the Beast, to the wedding feast of the Lamb. Rev. 19:7. |
| Chapters 20-22 | The Dragon’s Doom and Christ’s Victory |
| | And of course there is no debate that this last section ends with the new heavens and the new earth. |

With each of the seven visions, John surveys the entire history of the church, but each time from a different perspective and with different emphases. There is a progressive nature, but it is not fundamentally chronological, but rather a progression in intensity and finality. Any questions?[^3]

OK. What we’ll do now is to walk through the book—beginning with the first few chapters, then moving through one of the cycles of seven as illustrative of the others, and finishing with the conclusion of the book.

## Revelation as a Letter

This book begins as a letter to seven churches scattered throughout modern-day Turkey. The general pattern John uses to address each of these churches is to include a commendation, a rebuke, a solution, the result of not repenting, and a promise. We’ll take the sections to the church at Ephesus and Laodicea as examples.

__Ephesus (2:1ff)__: John commends them for their good deeds, their hard work and perseverance. He rebukes them because they “have abandoned the love they first had”, they are doctrinally vigilant but relationally cold. He calls them to do the things they did at first, and if they do not repent they will have their lampstand removed.

Then skip ahead to 3:14.

__Laodicea__: this church for better or worse is best known of all the churches for the rebuke they receive. Unlike the other churches (save Sardis), they are _not_ commended, but instead rebuked for being neither hot or cold but lukewarm. They do not realize their spiritual poverty; they assume themselves to be doing okay. They are encouraged to buy new gold which has been refined so they may be truly rich, white garments to cover their naked shame, and salve to open their blind eyes. If they do not repent, they will be spit out of Christ’s mouth like the lukewarm water they are; if they overcome they will sit with Christ on His throne.

Now. The genre of this section of the book is that of a letter, not of apocalypse. So our bias should be literal interpretation. It’s best, then, to understand these seven churches as churches that actually existed and to whom John is speaking specifically. But it’s also appropriate to see the issues being addressed as present in various churches throughout the history of the church. It should also be noted that each of these churches is first described in terms of who Christ is, and each of these churches is told what good will happen if they overcome their specific challenge. We should consider the admonitions that John gives these churches and seek to repent of ways our churches may be prone to the errors he is addressing, and rejoice that Christ is working through even flawed churches to establish His reign.

Well, in chapter 4 the scene suddenly changes, and John moves from addressing the seven churches and is taken into a grand vision of Christ and what He has for our future. 4:1, “After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, ‘Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.’” We’ll spend the rest of our time this morning following John on his journey into the very throne room of God.

## The Throne

Chapter 4, verse 2, John is “in the Spirit” and the first thing he sees is a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. The scene that now unfolds provides the framework for understanding what drives the rest of what we’ll read in this book. Verse three:

_“And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God, and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And around the throne on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within”_ (Rev 4:3-8).

Later we read that the twenty-four elders lay their crowns before the throne and say,

_“Worthy are you, our Lord and God to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.”_ (Rev 4:11).

This is the center of everything. At the center of history is not an impersonal chemical reaction. At the center of the universe is not chance and randomness. There is a throne, and on that throne there is a sovereign God who rules the world. John goes on to tell us many other things about the future. But he wants us to get this clear at the beginning.

At the center of everything is a throne—the throne of God. And we are called to ultimately trust nothing other than God on his throne. The world and all of us in it are not held in the hand of Caesar. We are not in the hand of any government or boss or family member. If we are Christians who trust in the Lamb who was slain, we are in the hand of the one who bought us with the Lamb’s blood. Therefore, the future is not meaningless. It is not anonymous. It is not foreboding and empty like a soon-to-be occupied casket. No, the future is full and bright for Christians because of this throne. Trust God for his perfect rule.

## The Lion, the Lamb on the Throne

But John didn’t just see God on his throne. John hears of the Lion.

Verse 5: _“And one of the elders said to me, ‘Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.’”_ (5:5).

Then John turns and sees not a Lion but the Lamb. He says,

_“And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I say a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.”_ (5:6).

Imagine John’s astonishment when he looks and sees not a lion but a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain. A Lamb! A Lamb that had been slain! A slain Lamb standing on the very throne of God!  Was the elder mistaken?  Thinking the slain lamb was the lion?  No. The lamb and the lion are the same thing. The suffering servant is the Lord of Glory. And this lamb is on God’s throne. He is in fact God himself and is being worshipped as God.

Incidentally, this pattern will repeat throughout the book. John hears one thing, John sees another, and they are the same thing—something fraught with theological significance. Lots of examples of this in the book of Revelation. Just to pick up one more, look ahead to chapter 7. John _hears_ in verse 4 of _“And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel.”_ and then in verse 9 we read, _“After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb,”_ The 12 tribes of Israel and the multitude from every nation, tribe, people and language, are the same thing. Seeing adds another dimension on top of hearing, and the fact that these two are the same is of enormous theological significance. The multi-ethnic church is the new people of Israel, the fulfillment to which that ethnic nation always pointed.

But back to chapter 4.

It is the lamb, and the lamb alone, who is able to open the sealed scroll of God. Only he had authority to fulfill judgment and redemption. Only he had purchased this redeemed company.

In a moment we are going to walk through the pattern of judgment that is repeated in greater intensity from the seven seals, to the seven trumpets, to the seven bowls. But let’s pause here to consider what we see here in chapter 5.

Only the Lamb controls when these judgments are unleashed and only the Lamb can save and protect the Redeemed from these judgments. Do you know how many of the 144,000 saints I mentioned before remain standing around the Lamb? Not 143,999, but 144,000. Twelve tribes times twelve, times one-thousand. The number signifies completeness. None of God’s people have been left out. Not one of them is missing. All of God’s chosen ones are sealed and protected from God’s wrath. The Lamb keeps those whom he has purchased with his blood.

In this book we see that terrible things will happen, but even in the midst of judgment God is in control and will work for the good of those who are his. __Hope in the book of Revelation is not found in the absence of suffering, but in God’s goodness and sovereignty that are displayed despite suffering, and even within suffering.__ That’s the message of the book that we see even right here at the beginning. God is in control. We can put our trust in him.

But we do move along to judgment. Chapter 6, verse 1.

## God’s Judgment

John tells us that, _“Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voce like thunder, ‘Come!’ And I looked, and behold, a white horse! And its rider had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.”_ (6:1-2).

As I mentioned before, chapters 6-16 are not a linear, end-to-end recounting of events in history. We’d have some pretty serious problems if that were the case; after all, how could the events of chapters 7 and on even take place after the sixth seal is opened in 6:14, as we read: _“The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.”_ (6:14). If we are to take these judgments as a linear recounting of events, then several of the remaining judgments could not literally take place.

Instead, what we see, as I mentioned earlier, is several cycles of seven that each cover the full spectrum of history from Jesus’ first coming to his second—with each cycle more intense than the last. But each cycle is describing the same time period- simply from a different angle. What we’ll do is consider just one of these cycles in order to get a flavor for them all. The seven trumpets, chapter 8.

Judgment begins with the land being burned with fire and hail. The judgments get progressively worse with part of the sea becoming blood, rivers and springs becoming embittered by a falling star, one-third of the sun, moon, and stars being darkened, locust demons coming out of the abyss, one-third of mankind being killed, and finally the kingdom of this world becomes the kingdom of God in chapter 11, verse 15.

Through all these events we learn important things about God’s judgment. Let’s consider some of these lessons. We see first:

__The Completeness of God’s Judgment__ (See 11:15-18; 22:12). In each series – the seals, the trumpets, the bowls the judgments – like a descending spiral -- repeatedly get worse. So complete is God’s power that even his extraterrestrial creation acts in concert with his judgment on earth: the sun is blackened, the moon turns red, and the stars fall. Not even death itself can hide us from the searching judgment of God (11:18).

__The Finality of God’s Judgment__ _“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.”_ (11:15b). This present world will end. There will come a day when it is all over. There is no appeal from God’s judgment. When God judges, the only response is the silence of assent and songs of worship.

__The Horror of God’s Judgment.__ The severity of his judgments is clear throughout the book. It will be a horrible thing to undergo the judgment of the Lord Almighty. Every kind of human will be horrified on that day…if the images are true, we do not help anyone by trying to make them seem less horrible.

__The Righteousness of God’s Judgment__. At the end of the seven trumpets, 11:17-18, the two elders praise God for his righteous judgment. 

_“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, for you have taken your great power and begun to reign. The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.”_

God’s judgments are complete, accurate, and appropriate. God’s judgment will not be an embarrassment: it is his vindication, and therefore cause for praise. And though this may not make sense to us today, let alone feel comfortable, Revelation tells us that one day this will all make sense. And God’s goodness will be vindicated.

## God will triumph

But the book does not end with judgment. After the seals, and trumpets, and bowls we see the defeat of the Beast, the fall of Babylon, and triumphant reign of Christ. Turn ahead to chapter 20, verse 11.

_“Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.”_

Before this throne, Satan and the dead are judged. God is sovereign over history.

Remember, when John is writing this the emperors of Rome, the most powerful kingdom the world had ever seen, were demanding obedience meant only for God. To resist could lead to death. John, an old man at the end of his days on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere, is proclaiming judgment on the kingdom of Rome and likewise on future kingdoms that are to come!  Why?  Because Jesus is coming back!  He will judge. The final word is not with Caesar in his Roman halls, but with Almighty God!

## From a Garden to a City

And that brings us to our final section in the book. With judgment past, we see a picture of our glorious future. All the events from Genesis 3 to Revelation 20 have been in preparation for a grand restoration greater than anything we have ever experienced. God is preparing a people for Himself who will live together with Him for all eternity. You’ll recall that the Bible began in a garden, the garden of Eden. But with God’s people increasing to a multitude no one can count, it ends in a city, the heavenly city of Revelation 21.

Of course, the description of this Heavenly City does not begin in Revelation, but way back in the Old Testament where God’s prophets prepared us for what John would describe here. You’ll see on your handout some of the parallels between Rev 21 and various passages in the Old Testament. Isaiah 65:17 describes the new heavens and new earth, Ez 37:27 and Lev 26:11-12 proclaim God’s dwelling will be with His people, Is 55:1 and 2 Sam 7:14 describe the provision that is made for citizens of this City, and throughout the OT we see physical descriptions of this City.

Do you think of Heaven as a City? You have may have mixed attitudes towards cities and for good reason. Even the Bible presents cities as Godforsaken places of through his judgments on Babel, Sodom and Gomorrah, Jerusalem itself, and (in the book of Revelation) Rome... With all this in mind, it is amazing to read what John sees in this last and perhaps greatest vision in the Bible. He does not see a bunch of disembodied beings inhabiting clouds and reclining in everlasting laziness. No, he sees an entirely new creation, and primarily he sees a new city—the city of holiness, the city of God, the city of God’s people.

God has prepared something even better than a garden for His people. __This City is the hope of all God’s people.__ John describes it like this,

_“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.”_ (21:1-2).

Skipping to verse 23, _“And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day –and there will be no night there.”_ (21:23-25).

Furthermore, the very effects of the Fall will no longer be with us, _“Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. __No longer will there be anything accursed__, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.”_  (22:1-3).

What a glorious place this will be! Death is replaced by life (21:4). Night is replaced by everlasting light (21:23-26). Corruption by purity (21:27). Divine curse by divine blessing (22:1-5). The city is one of brilliance (21:9-21). And the rebellion of mankind?  Rebellion is pictured throughout the Bible as a raging sea (e.g. Is 57:20, Ps 89, 93). And so the sea we saw around the throne in 4:6 was _“as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.”_  Without any perturbation. Rebellion quenched. And yet in this new heaven and new earth, 21:1: _“and the sea was no more.”_ Rebellion?  There is no such thing anymore.

And thus the peculiar shape of this city. 21:16, it is pictured as a perfect cube. Can anyone think of another structure in the bible of that shape?  [wait for an answer]

Yes!  The Holy of Holies, the Most Holy Place within the temple (1 Kings 6:20). With rebellion done, the entirety of God’s people will live forever in the very presence of God, in the heavenly holy of holies. We will worship Him, and him alone, for all eternity!

## Conclusion

Well, time to conclude. We will finally come face to face with God and rejoice. He designed it that way since the beginning of the beginning -- before time. He will wipe away every tear from your face. So, trust him! His Kingdom is coming!

God cares about the world He has created. He is in control. And He will finally act to restore all things to Himself.

The revelation of the New Testament is the revelation of the Kingdom of God. It began with the announcement of the Kingdom and the coming of the King in the Gospels. It progressed with the Kingdom’s expansion to the ends of the earth in Acts. It continued with various letters from the servants of the Kingdom, detailing how the Kingdom should be organized here on earth, who its members are, and what their life should look like. Those letters also warned that the Kingdom would face opposition. But the New Testament ends with the ringing declaration that the Kingdom of God, established through the blood of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, would prevail. And that this Kingdom, unlike every other kingdom this world has ever known, will never end. Which leaves each of us with the question: Are you a member of this Kingdom? Do you know the King? Are you serving the King? If so, then you will understand why John ends the New Testament on the same note that Matthew began it. Come, Lord Jesus. Your Kingdom come, your will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.

Let’s pray.
