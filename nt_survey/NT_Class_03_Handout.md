__The Calling Card of the Arriving King: Jesus is the “*Son of Man*”__

Daniel 7:13-14 Jesus refers to Himself as the Son of Man to indicate that he is the Messiah.  

1. Jesus has Authority

   - Authority over people (1:14-20)

   - Over sickness and demons (1:29-34)

   - Over sins (2:1-12)

   - Over nature (4:35-41)

2. Suffering Servant: Jesus Came to Die as a Ransom for Many

Ezekiel, Isaiah 53

Mark 8:31-38

Mark 15:21-31

## Application

Jesus evokes a response

1. Some believed (2:5, 5:23, 7:29)

2. Some were confused (4:13, 4:40. 8:14)

3. Some were antagonistic (2:7, 3:6, 3:21)
