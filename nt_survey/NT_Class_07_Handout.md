# Psalms: The Praises of God's King

_The Book of Psalms is the prayer and praise book of God’s Son and God’s people._

> “I have been accustomed to call this book... ‘An Anatomy of all the Parts of the Soul’; for there is not an emotion of which any one can be conscious that is not here represented as in a mirror. Or rather, the Holy Spirit has here drawn to the life all the griefs, sorrows, fears, doubts, hopes, cares, perplexities, in short, all the distracting emotions with which the minds of men are wont to be agitated. The other parts of Scripture contain the commandments which God enjoined his servants to announce to us. But here, the prophets themselves, see they are exhibited to us as speaking to God... draw each of us to the examination of himself in particular, in order that none of the many infirmities to which we subject, and of the many vices with which we abound, may remain concealed.” – John Calvin, Commentary on the Psalms, p. xxxvii
