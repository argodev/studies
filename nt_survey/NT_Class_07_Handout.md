# Romans: Kingdom Citizens Justified by Faith Alone

## Introduction

- The message of Romans: For in the Gospel the righteousness from God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, ‘*The righteous will live by faith.*’ 1:17

- Background

- Justification = ‘declared righteous’

## 1:1-3:20 Justification by Faith Alone is Necessary

> *Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.* 2:5

- God’s wrath is our biggest problem

- No one can be justified by their works

## 3:21-28 Justification by Faith Alone is Sufficient

> *The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe*. 3:22

- A sacrifice of atonement, a propitiation

- Two places where God’s wrath can be satisfied

## Ch. 4 Justification by faith alone did not begin in the New Testament

> *For what does the Scripture say? ‘Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.’* 4:3

- Is justification by faith really biblical?

- Imputation

## Ch. 5 The benefits of justification by faith alone in Christ

> *Therefore, since we have been declared righteous through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.* 5:1

- Have you spent time praising Him for the many benefits which have accrued to you as a result of His work on your behalf?

- Second Adam- how gracious is God that many sins are covered by one man, Jesus Christ!

## Ch. 6-8 Justification by faith alone but justifying faith is never alone

- Ch. 6 Justification by faith leads to a more righteous life

> *How can we who died to sin still live in it? Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life.* 6:2-4

- Chapter 7 & 8: the reality of ongoing sin, but also the certain hope of final victory for all who believe.

> *For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.* 8:29-30

## Ch. 9-11 Justification of God to man

> *Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Neither are all of Abraham’s children his descendants.* 9:6-7

- Salvation isn’t a birthright, but something that God works as he chooses for His Name’s Sake!

  1. God has the right to save some, and not save others (9:19-21).  

  2. God’s reveals His justice and mercy in the condemnation and salvation of sinners (9:22-24). 

  3. God has not changed his way of dealing with people- all must confess and believe (10:9-10,13).

## Ch. 12-16 Justification by faith alone produces renewed lives and relationships

> *Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law.* 13:10

- Individually

- Civically

- Corporately within the church
