# Philippians: The Fellowship of the Kingdom

This morning, as we get to the book of Philippians, we’ll see a wonderful twist on this. Because the letter isn’t just centered around the gospel; it is centered around gospel humility.  And it is gospel humility that is the key to unlocking the many famous imperatives in this book.  We’ve seen so far how the gospel upends the applicative commands in Paul’s letters so far.  How does humility do the same thing?  And what would be missing if we attempted to live in the way Paul describes with an understanding of the gospel, but not an attitude of humility?  Those are the questions we’ll address as we get into Paul’s letter to the Philippians.

## Background

The early church was unanimous in its testimony that Philippians was written by the apostle Paul.  It says so right at the beginning of the letter, and the many personal references of the author fit what we know of Paul from other NT books.

We don’t know when this letter was written in large part because we don’t know from where it was written.  It is clear that Paul is in prison [Phil 1:13-14], but whether this is his Roman imprisonment, as many have thought, or another imprisonment, in Ephesus or elsewhere, is not clear.  So the best we can nail down the date of this letter is to say that it was written sometime in the mid 50s to early 60s AD.

Though we don’t know when he wrote his letter, we do know quite a bit about the people Paul wrote his letter to.  He wrote it to the church in the city of Philippi.  Philippi was a Roman colony at the north end of the Aegean Sea (today is Northern Greece).  It was a strategic city in Macedonia. It was a major stop on an important road called the Egnation Way, which led from Byzantium (Istanbul), all the way across modern Greece to the Adriatic Sea. [route that Paul would follow from Neapolis to Philippi to Thessalonica on his second missionary journey as you can see from map]. It was also a popular place of retirement for former Roman soldiers and officials.

Paul founded the church in Philippi around 50 AD during his second missionary journey with Silas.  You may remember from Acts 16 that Paul had a vision of a man in Macedonia begging him to come over and help.  So Paul went to Macedonia, and stopped in Philippi. As an indication of just how Roman this city was, Paul didn’t find a synagogue there. Rather he found a place, just outside the city, where a few Jewish women gathered to pray. God used Paul to lead at least one woman to Christ, Lydia, who, as it turns out, wasn’t from Philippi.  [Acts 16:12-15]. Paul also healed a demon-possessed slave girl, which caused a riot and led to his and imprisonment. Miraculously, God freed Paul and Silas, and this led to the conversion of the Philippian jailer and his household to Christ.  Paul didn’t spend a long time in Philippi.  So, the church in Philippi was largely Gentile, born in the midst of suffering and persecution, and quickly bereft of its founder.  This was the beginning of the Philippian church.

So, as we go through this letter, keep in mind these circumstances:  Paul is writing from prison, suffering for the sake of the Gospel, and in fact speaking of the very real possibility of imminent death.  And yet, despite this uncertain future, his letter to the church is filled with joy. Paul makes reference to joy or rejoicing many times through the letter.

Also, keep in mind that he’s writing to a group of Christians who are probably fairly new Christians; who are scared and discouraged because of Paul’s imprisonment and their own suffering and danger of persecution.

So why did Paul write this letter? Given the circumstances, we might expect that the Philippian Christians were falling prey to some sort of heresy. But in fact, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Rather, it would seem that Paul had a number of practical reasons to write this letter.

First, he had apparently received a gift from the Philippian church and he wanted to thank them for it. (__4:10-19; read v. 18__).  So the book of Philippians is a thank-you letter!

Second, Paul is writing to update them on his circumstances, and to encourage them for fear that they might be discouraged because of his chains and imprisonment. (__1:12-30__)  So this book is a good book to turn to for encouragement if you are struggling with anxiety, fear, or discouragement.

Third, not only does he want to encourage them about his condition, he also wants to reassure them about Epaphroditis, who the Philippians had sent to Paul with their gift, but who had become ill and almost died. The Philippians had heard of this and were concerned, so Paul writes to reassure them and to send Epaphroditis himself with the letter. (2:25-30).  In this context Paul talks a lot about service for the gospel, so this is a good book to turn to if you need to remind yourself why we should be more involved in service and ministry at church.

But the main theme of the letter is above these circumstantial elements.   Above all else, Paul writes to deliver a powerful description of the humility of Christ in going to the cross, and urges his readers to grow in Christ-like humility.  And so this is a good book to turn to for all Christians to be reminded of our basic purpose: to model Christ to others in all ways, including in how he humbled himself to serve his people. You can see the outline of the book under point IV on your handout, but the main thing we’ll be talking about is our main theme — humility.

We’ll be criss-crossing the letter thematically, looking at what gospel humility is, and then four different ways that this letter applies it to our lives.  So first: __Gospel Humility__

When Paul tries to put his finger on the heart of what it means to imitate Christ’s love, he chooses to talk about humility.  And the place where he does this most powerfully is in the well-known passage at the beginning of chapter two (2:1-11).  

> If then there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, make my joy complete by thinking the same way, having the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves. Everyone should look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. Adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus, who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be exploited. Instead he emptied himself by assuming the form of a servant, taking on the likeness of humanity. And when he had come as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death— even to death on a cross. For this reason God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow— in heaven and on earth and under the earth— and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

To understand Christ’s humility more fully, we should remind ourselves of Jesus’ rightful majesty, and what he gave up or laid aside to become a servant.  He is “Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace” (Isaiah 9).  He is the one “like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven” who “was given authority, glory and sovereign power” so that “men of every language worshiped him.”  Whose “dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away” (Daniel 7).  “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.”  “For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him.” (Colossians 1)  

Jesus is King, heir of David, rightful ruler of Israel and all creation.  He is more than an earthly King; he dwells with the Ancient of Days and receives worship and everlasting dominion.  He is nothing less than God Himself.  And he has a mission.  He is the head of his people, the church, the Conqueror of Death, the Alpha and Omega, the firstborn and judge of creation.  Yet this same Jesus “did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.”  He became a mortal man, a squalling infant, the son of a carpenter in an unimportant backwater province.  He went unrecognized by almost everyone, had few followers, left no writings and established no school, was unjustly accused, wrongfully arrested, and executed as a criminal.  That is the extent of Jesus’ humility.  And he humbled himself to *save us*.

How much less are we called to?  Jesus, who was and is God, became a man.  We, who are not divine, must only acknowledge our actual human failings.  Jesus was and is perfect, yet became sin for us, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:21.  We, who are sinful, must only acknowledge and turn from our own sinfulness.  Our humility is ultimately a reflection of Christ’s perfect attitude.  We are called to __sacrifice our own interests__ for the sake of others, just as Christ did for us.  

This humility isn’t theoretical or merely an internal feeling.  Paul talks about obedience.  He exhorts us to do everything without complaining or arguing.  It seems that grumbling and complaining is one of the most common ways that we give away our lack of humility.  As the saying goes, everyone wants to be thought of as a servant, but no one wants to be treated like one. How do you respond when you are, or feel like you are being treated like a servant? Does your response reveal humility?

Our humility is not only a reflection of the love that Christ has shown us, it is also a demonstration that we have understood and grasped the good news of the Gospel. Paul warns the Philippians and us from taking pride in anything other than Christ and his work on our behalf.  He call all things “rubbish,” in comparison with “the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus.”  Humility, then, is not just a moral virtue we pursue, but rather the evidence that we have met, and been loved by Christ!  So, how does this humility display itself?  First, by our patience in suffering.

## A. Humility as Patient Suffering

Paul tells the Philippians that one of the ways Christians show humility is by enduring suffering for the sake of Christ with patience.  

Paul models patient suffering in chapter 1 when he reflects on his circumstances.  He is able to see that his imprisonment “has really served to advance the gospel” because “it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ” and “most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.” (1:12-14).  It didn’t matter that he had been wrongfully accused and unjustly imprisoned because God glorified himself and spread his gospel even through Paul’s hard circumstances. Paul is even able to rejoice at rival preachers!  “What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.”  

Paul goes so far as to say that he is equally happy with life or with death because with life he can continue working for the gospel and in death he is united with Christ.  “For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain,” he says in 1:21, a key verse in Philippians and perhaps the whole Bible, which might be the most succinct summary of the meaning of life and the Christian attitude towards death in the Bible.  He goes on to say “If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.” (22-24)

Think about this for a moment.  Isn’t it quite amazing?  Even amid thoughts of his own death, Paul is concerned for the Philippians.  We tend to think our suffering justifies at least a little bit of selfishness.  No sign of that here.  Paul’s chief concern, even when his own life is threatened, is the furtherance of the gospel.  In this he shows to the Philippians a model of laboring for the Gospel in difficult circumstances.  How is that?  Humility.  Paul saw himself as he ought.  As deserving of nothing, and yet gifted with the blessing of proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles.  That is how he can rejoice in God’s purposes even as his circumstances turn bleak.

Paul returns to his theme of patience in all circumstances at the end of the letter.  The Philippians had given him aid during his travels, and he wants to thank them but also to teach them that God cares for his people regardless of their circumstances.  “I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.” (4:11-13).  

In 1:27-30, Paul turns the attention to his readers and exhorts the Philippians to follow this model of patience in the midst of suffering and adverse circumstances.  As he says:

> Just one thing: As citizens of heaven, live your life worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or am absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, in one accord, contending together for the faith of the gospel, not being frightened in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction for them, but of your salvation—and this is from God. For it has been granted to you on Christ’s behalf not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, since you are engaged in the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I have.

Paul wants the Philippians — and, by extension, us — to be prepared to be in want, to be hungry, and to be suffering by knowing how to rely on God’s provision of strength.  How will we do that?  By “not considering ourselves to be better than we ought.”  Humility.  We deserve nothing but have received all things.  And so we rejoice.  These are helpful passages to turn to if you or a fellow believer are going through hard times.  Whether you are unemployed or lonely, struggling against temptation, or mocked for your faith, Paul’s reminders to the Philippians to rest in God’s strength and glorify God in your sufferings is a message for you.

## B.  Humility as Unity and Support for One Another

So — the humility exemplified in Christ displays itself in patience amidst suffering.  But there is another way it shows up in this letter: humility drives a church to be united and to support one another when in need.  The two virtues — unity and generosity — are flip sides of the same coin.  When Christians are united, they are moved to care for one another — and caring for one another builds and reinforces gospel unity.

Recall again how Paul begins his famous passage on Christ’s humility (2:2):  “Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.” Christians imitate Christ’s humility by putting disagreements aside and being like-minded, by having the same love, by cooperating together for the gospel and being one in spirit and purpose.  He says earlier (1:27) that he wants them to “stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel.” Again, Paul’s presumption is that acting in a manner worthy of Christ involves unity with other believers, both in our hearts and minds (spirit) and in action (contending as one man).

Paul applies the call to unity to the Philippians’ specific circumstances.  In 2:14 he tells them to “Do all things without grumbling or disputing,” and in 4:2-3 Paul urges two women in the church who had been destructively arguing to agree with each other, and for the church to help them resolve the dispute.  To all of them he says, “Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.” (4:5).  Paul’s exhortations suggest that complaining, arguing, disagreements, unkindness and sharp words are the clearest indications of a lack of unity in the body.  

Have you ever heard someone griping about church or someone in the church?  Complaining about the music, the pews, the preaching, or some relationship?  Or simply showing a lack of gentleness and using sharp words?  Paul models the right response:  he prays to God for unity and exhorts the church to intervene and work for unity.  Unity is not automatic:  it must be worked for and deliberately sought.  And the church has a definite role to play in fostering unity among its members.

Paul sums this up well as he begins the passage on Christ’s humility in chapter 2 (2:3-4): “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves. Everyone should look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.” Which is exactly what the Philippians had done by looking to Paul’s interests before their own.

And Paul concludes the letter by reemphasizing his thanks to the Philippians for their partnership in the Gospel and the way they had looked out for his interests.  He thanks them for their concern for him and for their generosity in providing financial support.  The Philippians’ recent gift was evidently only the most recent in a long-standing habit of generosity, and Paul praises them for their habit of provision, and in fact in verse 15 commends them as the only church that shared in earlier days and for sending aid “again and again when I was in need.”[^1]  Paul says that in sending gifts the Philippians “share my trouble” (4:14), suggesting that giving support and experiencing suffering are related — indeed, they are different ways of living out gospel humility.

## C. Humility as Dependence on God

So — humility displays itself in unity and generosity.  But ultimately, we cannot imitate Christ’s humility on our own.  None of us are able to suffer patiently, work for unity, or partner for the gospel solely by the strength of our will or our character. Paul reminds the Philippians that we can make no progress without relying on God and his gracious aid for our salvation and spiritual maturity.  This is another aspect of gospel humility: recognizing our sinfulness and limitations and learning to depend on God in faith for his righteousness and his provision and support.

Paul holds himself out as an example of dependence on God.  It was not as if he was humble because he had no reason to think himself great in the world’s eyes. He had the perfect religious resume.  “If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.” (3:4-6) But Paul insists that Christians “put no confidence in the flesh,” (3:3) that is, that they do not depend on themselves for salvation or spiritual growth.  Paul recognizes that he does “not hav[e] a righteousness of my own that comes from the law.” Rather, he is pursuing a righteousness “which comes through faith in Christ — the righteousness from God that depends on faith.” (3:9)

This is the crux of the gospel.  The Philippians had surely already heard this — they were, after all, Christians — but Paul does not shrink from repeating it to them, because it is so important.  Christians believe that we are lost and dead in our sins, totally unable to approach God of our own accord or achieve spiritual good on our own.   We cannot find peace with God on the basis of our own spiritual resumes.  Attending church, giving a tithe, helping the poor, and reading the Bible will not fundamentally alter my spiritual state, make me righteous, or appease God’s just wrath against me.  The one single thing that can do that is Christ’s death on the cross.  That is a difficult thought because of our natural (sinful) pride.  We want to earn God’s favor by our own effort and merit.  It takes gospel humility to recognize our complete inability to effect God’s mercy towards us.  Christ’s death on the cross opens up the way for God’s mercy.  Only if we repent of our sins and trust in Christ, God will forgive our sins and grant “the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.”

But our humble dependence on God does not stop with our salvation.  It continues in our sanctification — that is, our growth in spiritual maturity and holiness.  And while that work most certainly involves our own effort, even that is a gift from God and requires continued humility.  

Paul tells the Philippians in 2:12-13 “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.” What a magnificent statement.  All in one sentence Paul captures the Philippians’ responsibility right alongside of God’s sovereignty.  He commands them to “work out your salvation with fear and trembling,” by which he means that they must work and toil for their sanctification and growth in holiness, but that ultimately “it is God who works in you,” and so they can rest in his promises and humbly give him the glory.  There is no room for pride or boasting in our spiritual growth.

Finally, Paul shows that we are dependent on God not only for our salvation and sanctification, but for daily provision in all things.  He says in 4:6-7, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.” In everything we should turn to God in prayer.  And God is faithful to provide for his people.  If he does not give us exactly what we think we need, he still provides what he knows we need:  “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (4:7) Once again, do you see how humility changes all of this?  We depend on God not because it’s the right thing to do, but because, having honestly taken stock of ourselves, we desperately have no other option.  We cannot help but depend on God, to his eternal glory.

## D. Humility as Modeling Christ’s Example for One Another

Our last them, then: counter-intuitively, humility drives us to be an example of Christ for one another.  Paul points to himself as an example of the Christian life and exhorts the Philippians to be an example for each other.  

This might sound prideful.  Normally, if someone walks around saying “I’m an example.  Everyone should be like me!” it would sound arrogant, not humble.  But that is not what Paul is saying.  He is saying “Christ is an example.  Follow him!  If you see Christ in me, follow him!”  Paul is not pointing to himself, but to Christ’s work in his life.  It takes gospel humility to hold up anything exemplary in your life that others admire and want to emulate — and credit it to someone else.  But that is what Christians do.

And that is what Paul does.  He tells the Philippians to “join in imitating me, wand keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us.” (3:17) Note that the example he is talking about is not his religious resume, all his worldly accomplishments that earned him praise from me.  No, he specifically holds out his dependence on God (2:4-10), his perseverance (2:12-14), and his teaching (2:15) as models for the Philippians.  

Paul does not only point to himself as an example for the Philippians to follow; he urges the Philippians to be an example for others.  He tells them “Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ,” (1:27) as they anticipate future suffering.  He exhorts them to be “blameless and innocent,” so that they will “shine as lights in the world,” amidst a “crooked and twisted generation,” (2:15).  And he instructs them to “Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.” (4:5)  

Paul’s exhortation is similar to Jesus’ instruction to his followers that “You are the light of the world.  A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.”  The point, as Jesus says, is to “let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:13-16).  The goal is glory to God, not to ourselves.  Being an example of Christ is part of or witness to the gospel to unbelievers and part of how we encourage one another in the church.  

Note also how Jesus and Paul describe the Christian life.  Stars and cities don’t have to be special to be shiny:  it is in their nature to be so.  It doesn’t take a special kind of Christian to be an example of Christ.  Every Christian is one.  Christians’ holy lives should stand out and be a noticeable contrast to the world.  If you — or, better, your friends and family — examine your life and do not find examples of Christ’s attitude of love and humility, then you may want to carefully examine your heart and your faith.

## Conclusion

Philippians is a beautiful and uplifting depiction of Christ’s humility.  And it is an exhortation for followers of Christ to emulate his humility.  We are called to follow Christ in suffering, in service and unity with one another, in practicing dependence on God, and in modeling Christ to the world.

# I Timothy: Servant Leaders of the Kingdom

What makes a memorable, successful leader?

Short of winning an election, or "going platinum", or winning a Superbowl ring, what is the measure of such success in our day-to-day lives, our careers, our relationships and networks? In America today, the metric is pretty standard:  How productive are you compared to others, how much attention have you received in comparison to others, how do you stand out from the next person, from each other?

Well if that is how our culture measures the world, how does the Bible stack up against that?  More so, how does the Bible view a successful leader - what does he look like, how does he win? Well, let's take a look at a book, in the Bible, that talks about leadership in the church.  

## Background:  Pastoral Epistles

The Apostle Paul wrote three letters to men named *Timothy and Titus*, two of his most *trusted disciples* who later became leaders in churches themselves.  These letters [ 1 and 2 Timothy & Titus] became known as the “pastoral epistles” because they clearly frame many of the important aspects of good pastoring, as well as good, -- we could say, pasturing -- that is, how we as members of a church ought to live and thrive under church leaders.[^2]

Paul probably wrote I Timothy while under house arrest in Rome; Titus during the short period of freedom between his two imprisonments in Rome, maybe on his fourth missionary journey – to Spain; and II Timothy from a Roman dungeon very shortly before Paul was put to death. So if Paul died around 67 AD, I Timothy was probably written around five years before he died - *about, the early sixties AD*.

## Background: The Church

The longest of the three pastoral letters, 1 Timothy, is the most thorough treatment of Paul's instruction. Paul had left Timothy to minister to the growing church in Ephesus.  And there was good reason: As Paul writes in chapter 1 vs. 3:

> As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine”

A major problem in the Ephesian church was a heresy that combined a kind-of decadent Judaism (I Timothy 1:3-7) and false asceticism (I Timothy 4:1-5).

This wasn't really a surprise: Elsewhere in the New Testament, Paul warned the Ephesians to be or guard -- he called these false teachers "savage wolves" who will "come in among you and will not spare the flock."  (Acts 20:29)

So, Timothy would have been an interesting person to leave behind to shepherd this situation.  At first glance, he doesn't seem to have the manliness to stand up to these "savage wolves." We know that he was relatively young (about 40 at the time of this letter). It seems he may have been known for being timid. Paul had to remind him that:

> God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.  (II Timothy 1:7)

He was from Lystra and not from Ephesus.  He was probably converted during Paul’s first missionary journey and joined Paul in his second journey. (See Acts 16:1-5)  His mother was Jewish and his father Greek — so he would have had difficulty fitting well into either group.

But we also know that Timothy had a Godly heritage and had been mentored by Paul:  Both his mother and grandmother were Christians, and had apparently been saved prior to Timothy’s conversion (2 Timothy 1:5).  He enjoyed a close relationship with the Apostle Paul, who referred to him as his “son” in the faith  (see 1 Tim 1:2; 2:1; Phil 2:19-22).  And the feeling seems to have been mutual (2 Tim 1:4).  He traveled extensively with Paul and is mentioned in the introductions of many Pauline letters. (See I and II Thessalonians)

With that as background, we now turn to the main theme of the book:

Paul is preparing guidelines for how people should act as members of God’s household.  

1 Timothy 3:14-15 seems to capture pretty well the purpose of the book.  *“I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that, if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God”*

The goal: leading God’s people to conduct themselves as a church in a way that brings honor to God.  It’s interesting: a book that on one hand seems to be a manual of church structure and authority is filled with teaching about the gospel and about how Christians should live their lives.  It seems that teaching about church offices (pastors and deacons) actually is there as part of a larger theme of how the gospel should evidence itself in our lives — especially in contrast to the false teaching Timothy was confronting.  So a good thematic statement for this book would be something like this:

> “The true gospel, in contrast to false teaching, will always lead to godliness in its hearers, and that godliness is especially visible in our relationships within the local church.”

So, with that in mind, how does Paul communicate that message?

## Outline

You can see an outline of the book on the back of your handout.  Paul begins the book commanding Timothy to confront false teachers with the truth of the gospel.  But he does this in the most personal of terms. We see Paul declaring the gospel through the lens of his own life:   Read with me in 1:13, 15:

> “Though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief” Jumping to verse 15: “The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.”

The gospel.  Pure and simple.  In contrast to false teaching.

Chapter 2, then, begins a new section that moves us all the way to that summary statement I quoted earlier on HOW to CONDUCT ourselves in God’s household.  Confronting false teaching isn’t merely about saying true things, but about ordering our life together as a church as God commands.  So chapters 2 and 3 focus on gospel-shaped living within the church.  It talks about everything from who should teach to who should lead to how we should pray.

And then in chapter 4, we return again to the topic of false teaching.  And we repeat the pattern we saw in chapters 1 - 3.

A short message on false teaching (now it's a kind of Holy Asceticism), followed by an example of the gospel in the life of a believer.  This time the model is Timothy, and how he was trained up. With that comes another "trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance"  Look there in Chapter 4:9:  

> "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.”[^3]

And the pattern we saw in the first half the book continues.    Having seen the gospel through the lens of Timothy’s life, we now come across another very practical section about how we ought to love and treat the different kinds of people in the church - all the way to the beginning of chapter 6: Sections on young and old members, widows and families, more on elders and elders in training, and slaves and masters. And finally we finish the book, through the end of chapter 6, returning once again to the false teachers and how Timothy and other church leaders should behave in contrast.

So overall, a pattern repeated twice.  False teachers.  The gospel.  How we should order our lives in light of that gospel.  And then a conclusion contrasting false teachers with their gospel-focused counterparts.  In all, a celebration of the gospel and how Timothy can lead these people to live it out.

Now, then, with that outline, let's go a little deeper into the teaching.  But first, any questions so far on the background, the authorship, Timothy, Paul, the "heretics" the Ephesian church?

First Point.  What should a leader teach?  The gospel.

## What Should a Leader Teach?

Paul urges Timothy to "fight the good fight" by opposing false teachers and by devoting himself to being an example and faithful teacher of the Gospel.  Now, to understand this we need to see a little of what its opposition looked like.  

(1) Take a look at 1:3-7:

> "As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith. The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion, desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things that which they make confident assertions.”

So, We can see something of what these false teachers were teaching:  “myths and endless genealogies.” Paul says that these teachers promoted controversies, not the true loving work of God.  These self-appointed teachers might be confident talkers, says Paul, but they do not know what they are talking about.  They want to be teachers of the law: they want to teach people how to earn righteousness.  Here is the real problem:  You see, the news we have to declare as Christians is not fundamentally about our law-keeping or our obedience. The glad tidings we bear are not for ‘good people.’  See what Paul says in verses 8-10:

> "Now we know that the law is good, if one uses It lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine”

Paul's Point is that the gospel is for these kinds of people, and the law is what shows us that we really are like this (I Tim 1:9b-10a)…[this] is a message that brings joy to people like father-killers and slave-traders! Apparently, some teachers in Ephesus did not know that. They thought church was for good, respectable, law-abiding people!

Now, what is the simple and clear antidote to false teaching? The Gospel. Remember that passage I read earlier. Turn to 1:15-16. After urging Timothy to resist the false teachers in Ephesus, he gives that example from his own life. *“The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.”*

If the Gospel could penetrate Paul’s dark heart and make him an apostle of Jesus Christ, then we have the same hope ourselves.  If I am a sinner, what hope do I have if someone teaches me the law? But if I am a sinner, and someone teaches me grace, I have real hope.  ...This message is worthy of being believed and proclaimed over and above the message of the false teachers.

(2) The theme of false teaching versus the Gospel appears again, as I mentioned before, in chapter 4 as Paul instructs Timothy on the character and motivations of the false teachers he is to face.  Motivated by deceiving spirits, they seek to control others by forbidding people to marry and commanding them to abstain from certain foods (4:1-5).

Important lesson here for us in the church: Do not fail to notice how attractive false teaching is.  In chapter 1, we learn the false teaching is about the law, and the law is about right and wrong.  In chapter 4, we find that the false teaching included asceticism and self-denial for spiritual reasons…What was so bad about this teaching?

Well, whenever we do things in order to earn God’s favor, we have accepted false teaching. We have fundamentally misunderstood Christianity to be about us and our character when it is fundamentally about God and his character. You see how the gospel is woven into even this book of practical living and instruction. The Gospel exposes God’s gracious love and mercy to us in Christ, NOT our upstanding characters.

SO: Timothy's job, according to Paul, is to point out these teachers and their teachings to the faithful and avoid their foolishness, combating falsehood by teaching the true gospel of grace.

Yet, all this will be moot if Timothy does not follow Paul’s admonition at the close of chapter 4:16:  this is key for a leader in the church.

> “Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.”

How often have you heard, let's not worry about doctrine? Aren't personal relationships and love more important than beliefs?  

Paul is telling Timothy that for the man who would lead and teach God’s people, he must be marked by right living and right doctrine. And Timothy and every other teacher of God’s Gospel must first be those who have been transformed by that Gospel, lest they shift into teaching the Gospel as something others need, but which they have somehow mastered and overcome. While this message is aimed at Timothy as a pastor, these qualities are to be pursued by every Christian.

- So, how closely are you guarding your life and doctrine?
- Are you regularly reading God’s word?
- Seeking accountability with other Christians?
- Are you tempted to think people are too concerned about theology? Or are you tempted to be more concerned with right belief but apart from a changed life?

That pretty much summarizes the false teaching/gospel sections of chapters 1 and 4.  But with that foundation in place, how ought the life of the church reflect this gospel?  It all comes down to a question of authority.  And that’s chapters 2 and 3.

## Who should have authority?

### Government

At the beginning of chapter 2, Paul tells Timothy, *“I urge that supplications, prayer, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.”* (2:1-2). Government authority over Christians is a small part of this book, but it's good to see that Paul is not setting up some rogue religious system that rejects established authority.  Paul and the writers of the New Testament see authorities established and designed by God as a good thing, even while they recognize that those authorities may from time to time abuse their power.  Paul tells Timothy that authority is important and that good authority is a blessing — between Christians and the state, between men and women in the church, and between church leaders and church members. Biblical authority is a blessing for those who are beneath it.

### Women

Paul then moves on to defines the role of women in the church in 2:9-15.  And at the center of this teaching we read in verses 11-12: *“Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather she is to remain quiet.”* (2:11-12). Of course, with regard to the role of women in the church, our modern sensibilities often cause us to miss the positive force of Paul's message regarding the role of women.  Many strongly react against Paul because they see his teaching as essentially oppressive of women, chauvinistic.  However, Paul is stating in these verses that women *should* be instructed in the faith.  In Roman, Greek and Jewish culture, which would have shaped the Ephesian church, women had few rights and were rarely, if ever, included in religious instruction Paul's inclusion of them as fellow students is a socially radical command.  

But having said that, Paul also gives us the proper bounds of that inclusion. Women are not to exercise authority over men or publicly teach men in the gathering of the church.  And he grounds this prohibition not in cultural norms of the day, but in the very structure of relationships established at the beginning with Adam and Eve. Paul says, Chapter 2:13-14: *“For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.”*[^4]

The intent of gender roles in creation was supposed to be that Adam would lovingly lead Eve to obey the Lord. Instead Adam sinfully follows Eve to disobey the Lord. Eve herself had listened to the serpent -- the creature over which she was designed to exercise dominion together with her husband. 

In the created order, the serpent submits to woman, who submits to man, who submits to God. Instead the order has been turned on its head. Man submits to woman, who submits to the serpent, and God is out of the picture.  Paul’s point is that within the New Creation, within the church, the creation order is to be restored. The picture which has been flipped, is to be righted again.

Once: again there is to be self-sacrificial leadership, obeying the ordinances of God that were abandoned at the Fall.  Culturally, we often make an assumption that if people are to be considered equal in value, they must be equal in authority, or, at the very least, have equal opportunity to reach positions of authority.  This is not a biblical idea. Value and Authority are not equated.

[EXAMPLE: The perfectly divine Father eternally exercises loving authority over the perfectly divine Son. The Son, being in very nature God doesn’t see equality with God as something to be exploited, but makes himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, and becomes obedient to his Father to the point of death. He came, not to do his own will, but the will of the Father who sent him.]

So, within the church, men and women are of equal significance but are different in role.   Contrary to some claims, the apostle's arguments appear to be normative for all time and not culturally conditioned or bound.  If you want  to take a closer look at these issues, track down Mark Dever’s sermon on “Gender Roles in the Church,” or pick up *Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood*.

A few additional notes on this point, on how to apply it:

Women, don’t assume that these verses mean you cannot give spiritual encouragement to men. It is right for brothers and sisters to encourage and admonish one another, and that ministry of mutual edification should not be undervalued.

As a congregational church, the members of the church have the final say, and in a church that is made up of ever so slightly more women than men, the congregational guard against this church altering the Gospel is very much the responsibility of women.  Single women: invite an elder or two to visit to your small group.

Men who would be pastors, ask questions of women in your church about how you can teach them better; don’t assume that you know the answers.  These are just a few ways we can apply Paul’s teaching about men and women in the church.

## Elder and Deacon

Chapter 3:1

> The saying is trustworthy: if anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task. Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s church? He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.

> Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless. Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

Two things to notice about these lists.  

__First__ is just how unremarkable they are!  With the clear exception of “able to teach,” all of these qualifications ought to typify every Christian.  They make a great spiritual checklist for discerning whether you’re living as a Christian should live in this world.  Our leaders are not held to anything more than the rest of us!

__Second__, Paul’s emphasis is on the character of the leader and not the tasks of the leader.  We’re told little about the duties of the elder in the early church – most of what we find comes from the three interchangeable titles that they are given:

- __Elders__, showing that they are to exercise leadership;
- __pastors__, showing that they are to feed and protect the flock; and
- __overseers__, showing that they are those who must give an account for the lives of those under their care.

But here in  chapter three we’re given a list of things pertaining to the character, rather than their job.  Authority should not be given to people who are self-focused but to people who reflect the good and kind authority of God, thereby blessing those they serve by leading.

So, What are some ways that you love and care for others? 
Are you building God-glorifying relationships with those in the congregation who are different from you? 
Do you love ideas more than people? 
Do you cultivate a mastery of theology or a relationship with God? 
Do you pursue being right more than being godly?

Well, with that study of authority in place, let’s skip ahead to the next section of the letter where Paul applies the gospel to our relationships as a church.  Chapter 5.

Any Questions: Government, women in the church, elders and deacons in the church?

## How Should we shape our lives in the church?

We've seen how the gospel shapes the way authority looks.  Now, how does the Gospel shape the rest of our lives?  We, whether we are pastors or congregants, men or women, rich or poor, can be taught from this - we'll go through these groups in brief.

Paul begins with Timothy himself.  Paul tells Timothy how he ought to relate to and serve the various groups in the church.  

### 1. Timothy’s relationships across different age groups and gender (5:1-2)

Timothy is instructed to treat older men and women as parents and younger men and women as siblings; and he is to especially keep himself pure with regard to relationships with younger women.

The second thing we see is a section about the church’s care for widows.  Even here we should witness implications of sound gospel teaching.

### 2. Widows, Proper and Improper (5:3-16)

Apparently the early church kept a list of widows it was to care for.  However, some in this church were being added to the list even though they had family on which they should have been able to depend.  So in verse 8, Paul instructs: “If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”  

### 3. Elders (5:17-20)

Elders are to be respected and accorded honor, especially those who invest the most time and effort in teaching the word.  Here, we also get a NT basis for paying ministers in the word.  They are not to be lightly accused, but they are to be disciplined when wrong and to submit to such discipline before the congregation as an example to others.  

### 4. Slaves (6:1-2)

We’ll return to this in our discussion of Titus. While we don’t want to think of New World Slavery when we think of slavery in the New Testament, the New Testament encourages a love that releases slaves – wait for the class on Colossians & Philemon to hear more about that.

And then, as I said earlier, Paul concludes his letter with another contrast between false teachers and the true gospel through the rest of chapter six.  Here, he looks at treatment and love of money as a primary indicator of where a teacher’s motivation is, and thus, whether what he is teaching is good or bad.   It seems there was a connection between those who saw godliness as a means to financial gain (6:6) and those who had an *“constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth”* (there in 6:5)

So let us be careful with how we and our leaders treat money, and how we structure the finances in our church here at Immanuel to promote good teaching. (6:4).

## Conclusion

So what do we take away from all this?  A few final observations.

Paul gives us a nice little summary of his own letter right at the end:  chapter 6:20-21 – *"O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called ‘Knowledge,’ for by professing it some have swerved from the faith.”*
 
__First__, the need to always be on our guard against those who preach a false gospel.  Even here at Immanuel, this is something we must watch out for.

__But second__, the essential connection between teaching the true gospel and structuring our lives — as a church and as individuals — in a Godly way.  The broader evangelical culture suggests that there is little connection between our view of authority (say, of men in the church) and our ability to guard the truth of the gospel.  I think that the whole of 1 Timothy would take great issue with that.  Gospel truth promotes right living, but right living also is important in preserving the gospel, and as far as Paul is concerned, a right view of authority and leadership should be foremost in mind as we consider right living.  Guard your life and your doctrine.

__And lastly__, the connection between false teaching and false living.  READ Chapter 5:24-25:  *"The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later.”*

All sin, even secret sins, and disguised sins of false doctrine and unbelief, do have a way of eventually worming their way into the open.  In God’s providence, these things prove almost impossible to hide.  That should give us great confidence as we recognize leaders in this church.

We should thank the Lord for His kindness in leaving us with good leaders, never taking for granted good leaders who hold fast to the Gospel, who seek the good of Christ’s bride and not their own personal enrichment. But the main thing we should take away from I Timothy is not how great it is to have good leadership, but how great is the Gospel which shapes those leaders and those they would lead.  Praise God for the wonders of his gospel!

[^4]: Be prepared to explain why women do not wear head-coverings in our church even though that command also references the creation as justification.  In short: the commands both apply in all time since they are grounded in creation.  But we must apply them in culturally-appropriate ways.  Head coverings mean nothing to us, while other signs of marital commitment (such as the wearing of wedding rings) do.
