We cannot deal with sin ourselves

How sin perverts God's good purposes for his people (Ezekiel 36)

Atonement

  - Noah’s sacrifice pleases God
  - Abraham’s sacrifice of a substitute
  - Passover sacrifice turns aside God’s wrath
  - Levitical sacrifices show a penal substitute
  - Day of Atonement shows restoration of relationship
- What the concept of sacrifice teaches us about God and ourselves
- The ineffectual nature of Old Testament sacrifice (Psalm 51:4, Psalm 40:6, Hosea 6:6, Hebrews 10:1-3)
- The Old Testament bookended with the curse (Genesis 3, Malachi 4:6)

The "riddle of the Old Testament"

> "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.  Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished..." (Exodus 34:6-7)

# The story of the promise

The promise to Adam and Eve

> "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel" (Genesis 3:15)

The promise to Noah

The promise to Abraham (Genesis 12:2-3)

Law and rebellion

The promise to David (2 Sam. 7:11-16)

Unfaithfulness of the people and their leaders

The promise of the new covenant (Jer. 31:31-34)

Salvation from the exile yet the new covenant is not yet here

Does the Old Testament make any progress in God’s plan to redeem his people?
