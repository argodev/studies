# 1 Peter: Suffering in the Kingdom

In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.” Matthew 16:24). These words must have had a shocking effect on the crowd. Remember, these were Roman times. The cross Jesus was calling them to bear was not the nice spiritual symbol that we, in our day and age, see hanging from the necks, and tattooed on the biceps, of pop musicians or professional athletes, Christians and non-Christians alike.

No, the cross in Jesus’ time was a cruel instrument of state execution, a place where people suffered and bled and died. Here in this verse, Jesus was alerting his followers to a fundamental reality about the Christian life—namely, that it involves suffering. Jesus, in this verse was making clear that he was on his way to the cross and that if we would be his followers, we must go that way as well.

This is not to say that Christians are called to go out and court hostility through needless and unwise provocations. But in a world that is hostile towards God, it only follows that God’s people will face persecution as they seek to glorify him. Paul even says it point blank in 2 Timothy 3:12: “_Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted_.”

Paul’s words accurately describe the experience of countless saints throughout church history, and if we would endeavor to pursue a godly life, then they will describe ours, as well.

So, why do Christians suffer and how should Christians, in the midst of suffering, respond?

To answer these questions and others, we turn this morning to the book of 1 Peter. As much as any book in the New Testament, 1 Peter deals with suffering, why it occurs, what it’s for, and what we’re supposed to do when it comes our way.

So, in typical Core-seminar fashion, we’ll begin our study by considering some background information about 1 Peter before turning to the outline of the book [which you’ll see on the second page of the handout], then the major themes, and some practical application.

## Purpose

1 Peter has been described as a model of the “pastoral letter.” The writer, the apostle Peter, clearly intends in this book to refresh believers who are suffering for Christ with line after line of comforting truth. This comforting takes two forms.

__First__, it comes in the form of encouragement. We can see this in passages such as 1 Peter 1:3-6:

> 3Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! [pause there] According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, 5who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 6In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials.

The tone of these verses is incredibly optimistic—ecstatic, you might even say. Peter’s optimism might seem ironic or even delusional at first, given the difficult circumstances these Christians find themselves in, but unlike the baseless morale boosting so commonly incanted in our culture—the clichéd “everything is going to be alright” or “just positive thinking will get you through!”—the comfort offered in these verses is rooted in a historical fact of monumental significance: the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

Jesus’ resurrection—the fact that he defeated death and is alive and reigns now as King—gives Christians a “Living hope” and an “inheritance,” as verse 4 says, “that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.” _The hope and inheritance that we have in Christ helps put our sufferings in this world in much-needed perspective._ Indeed, in light of the riches we have in Christ and which we will enjoy for all __eternity__, this life and its hardships seem only like “__a little while__,” as it says in verse 6. _We’ll come back to this perspective in more depth later in the class._

__The second type__ of comfort the author gives in 1 Peter comes in the form of imperatives, or commands. Any of you who have run a marathon, taken the bar exam, or even experienced something as minor as a flat tire know something of the comfort that comes from being prepared, from having been instructed in how to respond.

We see this kind of comfort offered in passages such as 1 Peter 3:9, which commands suffering Christians, “_Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing._” When people insult us for loving Christ, we are to bless them, pray for them, and love them, taking queues from how Christ has loved us, we who were once his enemies. Following Christ, in other words, does not just mean that we suffer in the way Christ suffered, but also that we must respond to suffering as Christ did.

So, How did Jesus respond to persecution? 1 Peter 2:23 reminds us. It says:

> When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.

By blending Christ-centered imperatives like this with profound words of encouragement, 1 Peter offers an amazing arsenal of comfort for Christians who are suffering for the kingdom.

## Date & Audience

And suffering for the kingdom is exactly what Peter’s audience was doing: From Peter’s continued references to insults, slander, and malicious speech—he calls their troubles a “fiery trial” in 4:12—it seems that the Christians to whom he is writing are facing abuse, and verbal abuse in particular. Perhaps their devotion to Christ has made them the butt of jokes or the subjects of nasty diatribes in the town square. If you have ever had an unbelieving family member upbraid you for sharing your faith or worked under a boss who makes jokes about Christians, then you know the sting of such persecution, how it can lead to tears, even despair.

Peter pens his letter for such an audience feeling the bitter sting of social ostracism because of their allegiance to Christ.

We know a bit about the location of the original audience as well: Look at verse 1: “_To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia._” -- he is writing to Christians in what is now modern day Turkey.

And we have a good idea of where Peter was when he wrote this: he gives us some clues in 5:13, as he concludes the book. In that verse, he makes reference to writing from Babylon. Here, as in Revelation, Babylon is likely a symbolic reference to the city of Rome.

Also, In that same verse, Peter refers to Mark, but not to Paul. This is telling because we know that Paul was with Mark in Rome until 62 AD, the year that Paul was released from his first Roman imprisonment. For this reason, most scholars believe that 1 Peter was written around AD 63, after Paul’s release but before the Roman Emperor Nero’s intense persecution of Christians begins. So this letter was not penned to Christians experiencing the threat of imprisonment and death; that was to come later. Instead, the persecution these believers were facing was of a type that we would more commonly face here, today, in Knoxville as family, friends, and even strangers mock us for our hope in Christ.

The date of the book is important to understand because it means that the letter was not only a comfort to Christians already in the midst of suffering, whether social or economic, but that it was also helping to prepare its readers for harsher forms of persecution that were to come – (We might also consider that we, in studying this book now, may be doing the same thing ...).

## Structure & Outline

Let’s now take a look at the structure of the book, which will introduce us to some of the themes that we will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.

So, how does Peter organize his encouragements and commands? Unlike Paul’s letters, which often divide nicely into sections of theological argument and then sections of application, 1 Peter fuses the two, tethering imperatives to theology and vice versa, often in the space of a single verse. You will find that Peter reprises similar themes again and again, adding layers and nuances as he moves along.

Throughout, Christ is presented as the unique and blameless savior who rescues his people from the eternal suffering that they deserve. He is also presented as an example of how God’s people are to face up to suffering this side of heaven.

### Chapter 1:1-2

Peter begins the letter by describing Christians in two ways. First off, he calls them “_God’s elect_,” God’s chosen people, his representatives in the world. Then, in the very next phrase, he refers to them as “_exiles of the Dispersion_.” This juxtaposition—that Christians are both God’s elect and strangers in the world—helps order Peter’s commands and encouragements throughout the letter. First, he will focus on what it means to be “_elect_,” and then move to what it means to be “_strangers in the world_.”

### Chapter 1:3—2:10

And then we jump into the letter with verse 3 of chapter 1. The benefits and demands of being God’s elect, God’s chosen people, are the focus of this section, through 2:10. Peter reminds us of the living hope and inheritance we have in Christ. As we read in verses 10-12 of chapter 1, our salvation is made all the more glorious because of how it was prophesied in the Old Testament. So glorious is our salvation, in fact, that, they are “Things into which angels long to look.” Peter writes in verse 12, before shifting to the responsibilities that come with being identified as God’s people. This section is perhaps best summed up in verses 15 and 16, in which Peter demands of Christians what God demanded of his people in the Old Testament. He writes:

> But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”

### Chapter 2:11—4:11

In the next section, the longest in the letter, Peter elaborates on the fact that God’s holy people are also, quote, “sojourners and exiles.” To this end, he implores them, in the words of a couple New Testament scholars, to exhibit “_a lifestyle different from, yet attractive to, the hostile world in which they live_.” Being saved from the fate of this world does not exempt us from our responsibilities as workers and citizens and spouses. No, in fact our salvation frees us to be faithful in our sundry roles. The lifestyle Peter has in mind is characterized supremely by Christ-like submission—along with good and peaceful relationships with other Christians, and wherever possible, with non-Christians, too.

### Chapter 4:12—5:14

In this final section, in many ways the crescendo of the book, Peter launches into appropriate responses to suffering. He is emphatic that Christians endure suffering “according to God’s will” by 1) entrusting their lives and circumstances to God and 2) by continuing to live righteously. Peter begins in 4:12, “_Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you... But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings._” Also, chapter 5 calls on church leaders to care for the flock for the right reasons and on church members, “young men” especially, to submit to their overseers. And the book closes with Peter urging his audience once more to “Stand firm.”

----

You might summarize the book, then, in this way: The topic is persecution, and our confidence is the living hope and inheritance we have in Christ. But what is our goal? What are we to work toward given that confidence? IT IS NOT simply to survive persecution, BUT to turn it into a witness. 2:12, “_Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation._”

Now, what primarily will accomplish that? What aspects of life should we focus on to put forward a positive witness in the mist of persecution? The answer is surprising. Submit to the State. Submit to your boss. Submit to your husband. Submit to the church. Submission. To authority. A good thing to think through the next time you struggle in this area: right behavior toward authority is a primary way in which we witness to the truth of the gospel, even in times of suffering.

Now that we have got our bearings in 1 Peter, having covered some of the background and structure of the book, let’s turn to some major themes.

## Major Themes

As I mentioned in the introduction, 1 Peter is a book for Christians going through tough times. But let’s be clear, Peter is not talking about the suffering people face when they do evil. This letter is not written to crooks, for instance, offering them pointers about how to endure a prison sentence. Peter writes in 2:20: “For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure” Christians should never face this kind of suffering, the suffering that comes from doing wrong, because Christians should not do such things. And by extension, Peter isn’t writing about suffering that stems from our foolishness, like not managing our money well, refusing good counsel, or harboring ungodly patterns of thinking.

But neither is Peter talking about the suffering that comes, say, from things like natural disasters, wars, or economic turmoil. He is not talking about unemployment or disease or broken hearts. Although we find direction for some of those situations other places in Scripture, and although the pain caused by them is real and can be devastating – Peter has another kind of suffering in mind in 1 Peter: That is, _explicitly_ the suffering that comes from following Christ.

His readers were going through rough times because of their faith. Once, these individuals were accepted by everyone as good people. Now that they had become Christians and were doing good, they were suffering “various trials.” (1:6).

Well, a number of questions result. (1) Why is this suffering occurring? (2) When will it end? (3) And how can we endure in the meantime? The answers to those questions, the themes that run through this letter, are our focus for the rest of our time together this morning.

We’ll begin by answering that question, “why is this suffering happening?” by looking _first_ at the relationship between holiness and suffering, and th_en the relationship between Christ’s suffering and ours. We’ll answer the question, “When will it end” by taking up the _third theme_, that of vindication. And then finally, we’ll answer “How can we endure?” by examining Peter’s theme of a right response to suffering. We’ll step through each of these four themes in turn.

### A. The relationship between holiness and suffering

First, Peter makes it clear that Christians suffer because God is our Creator and Lord, and he has chosen us to be his special people. Think back to chapter one, verse one. God’s elect, strangers in this world. Cause and effect. As God’s elect, we are called out of this world to be holy, to be set apart. Peter writes in chapter 2:

> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy (2:9-10).

Notice that _God_ has done this. We were not his people, and then he made us his people. And now that we have been made holy, we are called to live lives of holiness. SO GOD MAKES US NEW, and then we LIVE ANEW. As Peter writes in chapter 1:

> As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct;, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.” (1:14-16).

Our holiness, like God’s holiness, combines the idea of “set-apartness” and the idea of Christ-like purity. God has made us holy. And if God’s people live as a holy people, the world will think they are strange. Why? Because Christians live in reverent fear of God rather than in conformity to the world. The Christian, as Peter writes in chapter 4:2, is the one who will

> Live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; (4:2-4).

Christians, in a sense, live in two worlds at once. The new world has begun for us because God has given us a new birth. On the other hand, we continue to live within the old world, which is the only world non-Christians see. So our actions and attitudes, comments and commitments, seem strange, even bizarre, to them. 

You see, Christianity is not solely an arg_ument over doctrine. It is also a witness borne by the way your new life says to your non-Christian friends, “There is a different way to live.” And the fact is that people do not like to be confronted with a different way to live. It implies that they might need to change the way they are living.

So what do we do with this first theme? It’s a reminder that some degree of abuse from the world around us is not only normal for Christians, it is a good diagnostic that things are going well for us in our life of love for God. So use this letter both to inform exactly how our lives should be different from the world around us, and as a source of comfort when that holiness results in persecution, as it so often does.

### B. The relationship between Christ’s sufferings and ours

But as I mentioned earlier, there is a second reason why we suffer as Christians: we are, in fact, called by God to _participate_ in the sufferings of Christ.

The book is replete with references to the suffering of Christ, to his blood, to his rejection, and to his death. In the most importance sense, Christ’s sufferings were unique. He died for our sins. Christ was a substitute, bearing God’s punishment for those who would repent and believe in him. But in a secondary sense, Peter hears a calling and sees an example for the Christian in Christ’s sufferings. They present a model for what we Christians are to do as we continually repent of our sins and follow him. 

In 2:20-21, Peter writes, “_For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps._”

So with this in mind, we recognize that we suffer because Christ suffered. And just as his sufferings made more glorious his victory over sin, our suffering will result in all the more joy when he and his people are finally vindicated.

### C. Future vindication

But suffering is not the only thing promised for those who follow Christ. A third theme of 1 Peter is that one day our suffering will end. Christ may be our example in suffering but he is also our example in vindication. Don’t miss this: Our rejection on earth is a passing human verdict. It is not final, and it is not divine. We will be saved through Christ’s own vindication. Peter presents Noah as an example of one who was vindicated in chapter 3, verse 20-22. In the ark built by Noah, it says:

> Because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt form the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

Recall how Noah was ostracized by his neighbors for trusting God and building the ark. Recall God’s faithfulness to him, and his small crew, during the flood. So you, Christian, if you struggle in the face of opposition, wondering if something is wrong because of your suffering, look to the example of Christ. Look also to the example of Noah. God _will_ vindicate those who truly follow him.

### D. Right responses to suffering

So we’ve established that suffering for us as Christians is a given – for at time – but that it too will pass, as God vindicates us in his glory. But let’s zero-in a bit more on this theme of suffering. Peter has much to say on how we ought to respond:

So first, we are to be Witnesses...

#### 1. Witness

Peter calls on us, in the midst of suffering, to be witnesses to non-Christians and even to desire the good of those who persecute us. Peter, the disciple who denied Jesus three times and then watched Jesus suffer for him, learned this from Jesus’ example. He writes,

> When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. (2:23-24).

Peter knew firsthand the forgiveness of Christ. He knew firsthand how good Christ could be even toward one who had denied him. We must also remember how good God has been to us. We deserted him, yet he responded with incredible love toward us. How then can we treat those who mock us in any other way?

#### 2. Love

Peter also calls us to show love to one another. This is particularly difficult and important when the church is suffering through strife and persecution. You know how when the going gets tough, we can grow short with one another or withdraw from one another completely [this is something I struggle with personally – I am inclined to withdraw when in tense situations]. When stress afflicts the church from the outside, stress on the inside follows. Just as pressure causes cracks to appear in a building, so it will cause fissures in churches. So Peter writes very clearly in 4:7-10:

> The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace

In times of strife and spiritual attack, Christians should band together, uphold one another—in short, love one another with the very love of Christ.

#### 3. Submit

Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly in a book concerned with suffering, we have Peter’s extended imperative that Christians submit to authority. He keeps this theme up beginning in chapter 2:13, and running through much of chapter 3. In chapter 2:13: “_Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good_.”

He goes on to command servants to submit to and respect their masters, wives to be subject to their husbands, and, later, he calls on the church to submit to and serve each other. Why so important?

Submission—to authorities, to husbands, to masters, to elders, to one another—is befitting of Christians because it displays our hope and trust in a higher authority – it enhances our witness about God. Paul, in Romans 13, confirms that God has instituted and ordered authority in the world:

> For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. (13:1b-2).

Christians should respect authority because it comes from God, and this bolsters our witness as those who follow God. 

But what about when this authority is abused, and even used to ridicule us for doing good? Should Christians respect authority then? Well, though we should never submit to authority to the point that we disobey God, Peter—like Paul in Romans—makes it clear that the normal pattern is for Christians to submit to authority, in good times and in bad. 

This brings us to the second reason why submission is befitting for Christians: because it evidences our eternal freedom in Christ. Peter’s admonition in 2:13, “Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution” is paired in verse 16, with the admonition “_Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil._” As Christians we can submit, even if we are persecuted for our faith by the people in authority over us, because we know that Christ, the ultimate authority, who was raised from the dead and now sits at the right hand of God, will have the final word.

So we have nothing, ultimately, to fear. We are free. And we can submit, and even do it with joy, knowing that we are living in a way that commends Christ.

So Peter instructs slaves or servants in 2:18-19, to “_Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly._”

[Passages like this are particularly meaningful to me when I contemplate the various injustices that each of us may see or experience at work – if we have a boss who manages selfishly, or even acts cruelly or mockingly once he or she understands your faith.]

Likewise, Peter commands wives in the beginning of chapter 3 to “_Wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives_”

In both of these instances – submitting to your master, or submitting to your husband – submission is presented as a way to witness to the lost and share in Christ’s sufferings. Peter again reminds us that we have the greatest example of submission in Christ himself: 1 Peter 2:23, tells us, Christ “_did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly._”

## Conclusion

Well then, it’s time to conclude. Peter punctuates his letter with marshalling words of encouragement. Read with me just a few of these strung together: 

_“Prepare your minds for action ... Arm yourselves with the same way of thinking (as Christ) ... Be self controlled and alert ... commit [yourself] to [your] faithful Creator and continue to do good ... Stand firm._” (1:13, 4:1, 4:19, 5:8, 5:12).

Peter himself did that. Early historical sources inform us that Peter died being crucified in Rome as a martyr, because he was living for Christ. Commit yourself to your faithful Creator and continue. Stand fast.

Consider what God is calling _you_ to. Are you being called to an initial commitment to Christ? To give up a particular sin? To be a witness? To _go_ for him? To _stay_ for him? What is holding you back? “Commit [yourself] to [your] faithful Creator and continue ...” Continue to do good.

# 2 Peter & Jude: Perseverance in the Midst of Falsehood

## Introduction & Purpose: False Teaching “Among You”

One of my favorite things to do when I take a flight somewhere is to spend some time browsing through the airport bookstore.  The bookstore is a reminder that we live in a pluralistic age, where atheist manifestos sit in the same sale bin as Buddhist meditation guides and commentaries on the Qur’an.  As a Christian, I walk through and notice plenty of falsehood:  everything from the book _God Is Not Great_ by the late atheist Christopher Hitchens, to a Hindu text promising “A Life of Purpose, Happiness, Prosperity, and Freedom.”  

Now, I must say that it’s discouraging to see these titles; these books are dangerous, they deny the one true God.  But it typically doesn’t ruin my flight – this is what we expect from people who don’t claim to believe in Jesus.  _But_ what happens when I get to the Christian section of the bookstore?  Is that shelf full of truth?  If I grab any book with a Christian label, will I arrive in my destination as a wiser and more faithful follower of Christ?  

With that question in mind, listen to the Apostle Peter’s words from 2 Peter 2:1:  “But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies” And then listen to the 4th verse of the letter written by Jude:  “For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and lord, Jesus Christ.” 

In 2 Peter, there “will be” false teachers that come; in Jude, they have already “crept in” unnoticed.  But did you hear what phrase both authors use:  “__among you__.”  These two letters aren’t about defending the faith against Roman polytheism or Greek philosophy.  They’re fighting something even more dangerous: falsehood with the Christian label.  Poison wrapped up like a candy bar.  The question is:  will we be those who eat the poison?  Or will we be alert and aware?  As you see there under “purpose,” Peter and Jude write _To warn Christians against false teaching and to encourage them to persevere in the true faith_.

So, first, we’ll look at some background and an outline for each book, and then we’ll talk about four main themes, four certainties that these books call us to know.  We’re going to jump around a bunch between these two letters, so you’ll want to keep your finger or a pen on both of them as we go.  

## II.  Authorship, Audience & Context

Let’s begin by talking about who’s writing.  __Please turn to 2 Peter__ 1:1. The book begins, “_Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ_” We see the author here identifies himself as Peter, and then look at 1:16:  “_For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eye witnesses of his majesty._”  Peter goes on to tell about how he personally saw the transfiguration of Jesus.  

Who’s Peter writing to?  Look over at 3:1:  “_This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder._” It’s likely that the first letter is the Biblical letter of 1 Peter, which as we saw in 1 Peter 1:1 was written to Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor, modern day Turkey.  Peter wrote that letter to encourage believers as they suffered through persecution.  But now, it’s not just attacks from the outside that concern Peter – it’s attacks from within.  And Peter says in 1:14 that “_I know that the putting off of my body will be soon._” – he can tell that his death is near.  And so he pens one final warning to his people.

__Turn over to Jude__ and let’s ask some of the same questions.  Who wrote it?  Verse 1, “_Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James._”  Scholars agree that the James he’s talking about is James the half-brother of Jesus and the leader of the Jerusalem church who wrote the book of James.  This means that Jude too is a brother of Jesus.[^1]

Who is he writing to?  Verse 1 makes it clear that his audience is Christians:  “_To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ._” When we look at the rest of the letter, we can guess that his readers were most likely Jewish Christians, because Jude refers to some characters and stories that would have been known in the Jewish community.  Now, if you read through Jude this week, you’ll probably be curious about these references because a couple of them don’t actually come from the Old Testament.  Jude alludes to a story about the archangel Michael in verse 9[^2] and quotes from a book called 1st Enoch in verse 14.  What’s Jude doing here?  He’s not saying that these things are scripture.  Instead, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he’s illustrating his points using stories that his audience would be familiar with.  The things he refers to are true, but he’s not suggesting that all of 1 Enoch is inspired or inerrant.  Paul did the same thing when he quoted true statements from non-inspired Greek philosophers in Acts 17 and 1 Corinthians 15[^3].  

Now, one of the interesting things about these two books is just how alike they are.  They don’t just deal with similar themes, they actually share the same language in many places.  For this reason, it’s likely that the books were written in light of each other.  In the early days of Christianity, letters such as these would have been widely distributed, so it seems like for the sake of having a unified message, one of the writers decided to echo phrases and themes from the other letter.  You see in your handout there a chart that shows which verses resemble each other.  You can look at that at home and notice all the similarities.  

Which letter came first?  Really hard to say.  But whatever the order of authorship, what we should take away is that the reality of false teaching was serious enough to deserve two letters in the New Testament, and so it’s certainly serious enough for us to take notice and examine closely.

## III. Outline

With that background in place, let’s look at how these books are structured so we can see how the authors mount their arguments.  You’ll see the outlines on the back of the handout.  

### 2 Peter

Looking first at 2nd Peter, you’ll see that in many ways it’s a symmetrical letter.  It begins and ends with exhortations for believers.  First, in 1:1-15, Peter reminds them that they are saved only by God’s power and calls them to “make every effort” to live in a way that confirms God’s work in them.  Similarly, the book closes at the end of chapter 3 with an instruction to “make every effort” to live in holiness as we wait for the second coming of Christ.  In the the second section, Peter gives reasons we can be confident that Jesus is returning, and in the 4th section, 3:1-13, Peter explains what will happen when the day of the Lord comes.  The middle section, then, chapter 2, is really the center of the book’s message.  Peter describes the false teachers, their godless way of life, and the horrific destruction that will God will pour out on them.  

### Jude

And we see a similar structure in Jude.  It’s one of the briefest books in the Bible – you can tell that Jude is like a loving father who is spurred to passionate writing by the dire circumstances his children face.  Like 2 Peter, the center of the book is a portrait of the empty lifestyle of the false teachers and the judgment that awaits them.  And immediately before and after that center portrait are again two exhortations – first, in verses 3-4, to contend for the faith, and second, in verses 17-23, to be built up in the knowledge and love of God.  At the very beginning and end of the book, Jude in his greeting and doxology reminds his readers that in the midst of such falsehood, God is a true and faithful hope.  God is the one who called them, and God is the one who will keep them from falling until they appear before his glorious presence.

## IV. Main Themes

Let’s turn to 4 major themes we see in these books.  You can follow along on the 2nd page of your handout.

### A. The Certainty of Your Call

Think about what Peter and Jude’s readers are facing.  You’ve got false teachers looming, spreading error and confusion like confetti around the early church.  In this climate, it was key for Christians to be sure of their salvation.  So, first, the authors tell them that their __salvation is utterly and totally God’s work__.  
Look, for example, at the second half of Jude v. 1: “_To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ_.”  Being called means being chosen by God personally for new life in Christ.  

Peter says something similar in 2 Pet. 1:3-4.  Go ahead and turn there:  “_His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them  you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire._” What a comfort these words are:  __He__ has given us everything we need for life and godliness.  It’s through __His promises__ that we escape the corruption of sin and become spiritually alive.  Verse 1 says even our faith is something we’ve received from God.  Jesus died and rose for the salvation of sinners.  And by repentance and faith, we are clothed in the pure, spotless, and complete righteousness of Jesus.

And yet, even though our calling is from God, it has implications for us.  Peter continues in verses 5-11:  “_For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ._”

He’s saying:  God has saved you.  Now, your responsibility is to live in such a way that confirms that you really are saved.  Here’s a great example of how the Bible upholds both God’s sovereignty and human responsibility:  It’s God who calls, and yet God’s call results in our action.  The image of adoption is useful for illustrating this – the Bible says elsewhere that God has adopted us as his sons.  And what do children do?  They’re supposed to live Iike their father.  They uphold the family reputation.  It’s like he’s saying, “You’ve been made part of the family by grace, you didn’t earn it, and you can’t lose it.  Now, as you imitate the Father and live like him, your assurance that you really are part of the family will deepen and grow.”    

So, Peter tells us to “__Be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election__” – verse 10.  How? We make it sure by what we do: “For if you practice these qualities you will never fall.” – not meaning that you’ll be perfect in this life or that you’ll never sin, but that the pattern of your life will confirm that your repentance and faith are genuine.  What things do we do?  Verse 5 – we make every effort to grow in Christ-like virtues and qualities.  

To put it in more theological language, sanctification, the process by which we become more like Christ, is both passive and active.  It’s passive in that we depend totally on God’s strength to grow us – verse 3, his power gives us all we need for godliness.  He has given us his Holy Spirit.  And it’s active in that we are responsible to pursue holiness the way an athlete fights for the gold medal.  

So let me ask us this morning:  when was the last time you __examined the fruit of your life__?  Look at the qualities Peter lists in verses 5-7 – goodness, knowledge, self-control – do you see evidence of these virtues in your life more and more as you follow Jesus?  Do you expend effort on growing in godliness?  Can you think of one way this upcoming week you could “make every effort” to grow in these characteristics?  One of the ways we can serve each other as brothers and sisters is by helping to give one another this assurance that Peter is talking about.  We should notice evidences of grace in the other members of this church, and we should tell them about it!  “Hey, I just wanted to let you know, I can see how God has grown you in perseverance this past year and you should be comforted to know that the Spirit is at work in you!”  

Jude’s letter has a good reminder for us here.  He says in verse 21, “_keep yourselves in the love of God_.” – that’s this kind of active sanctification we’ve been talking about – but then he adds, “_waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life_.”  It’s not our good deeds that cause us to persevere to the end.  It’s the __mercy of Jesus__.  So:  one of the ways we _know_ we are saved is by the evidence in our lives.  But the way _that_ we are saved is by trusting in the mercy of Jesus alone.  

The first certainty is the certainty of our call; Second is

### B. The certainty of God’s truth

When falsehood is waiting around every corner, we don’t just need to be certain about our own faith – we need to be certain about what’s true.  

So, Jude tells his readers in verses 17-18 to __recall the words of the apostles__.  Their teaching is true.  They predicted false teachers would come, and now false teachers are here, so that’s one good piece of evidence that their teaching is correct!  

And then in 2 Peter chapter 2 he says, “listen, the false teachers will make up stories and introduce heresies.”  But we have something far better:  Look __at 1:19-21.__  “_And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit._”

Why should we trust the writings of the Old Testament?  Because they are God’s Word.  Here we have one of the clearest statements in scripture about the Bible’s inspiration.  The authors used words and concepts natural to them, but the source of the revelation was the Holy Spirit.  So if anyone comes and teaches in opposition to the scripture – then they teach in opposition to God himself.  

And, importantly, God’s Word is __not just the Old Testament__.  Look at 2 Pet. 3:15-16: “_And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures._” This is a significant verse, because we have one of the early church apostles already calling Paul’s writing scripture.  And, what a comfort to know that we aren’t the first to find some parts of Paul’s letters hard to understand, right?!  

All of this should be a reminder to us:  A Christian is an echo-chamber of God’s Word.  The church is the community in which God’s Word reverberates.  I appreciate in 2 Peter 3:2 where he tells his readers and us, what he wants us to do, straight up, pure and simple:  “_you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets._” What do you do to keep God’s Word on your mind?  He says in 1:19 that we should pay attention to the Word like we would to a light shining in a dark place.  If you’ve ever been out in the woods late at night; if you’ve ever been in a dark area where you don’t know how to get back to your cabin or your car; what do you need?  The light.  Maybe the problem is that we so often forget just how dark the world is.  We get comfortable, our retinas adjust, and we think we can make it on our own in woods.  We should pray that each day we might recognize the value of the light of God’s Word.  We should point one another to the light of God’s Word.  What’s the greatest resource I have in making sure I know how to discern which “Christian” book I pick up at the airport is actually true – the light of God’s Word.  False teachers --> they breed uncertainty.  God’s Word --> leads us to certainty of the truth.

Let’s turn to theme that is front and center in each of these books:

### C. The Certainty of Bad Fruit from False Teaching

Peter says in 2 Pet. 3:3, “_Knowing first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires._” One of Peter and Jude’s main goals in writing?  It’s that their readers wouldn’t be surprised.  They are saying:  you can be absolutely, 100% sure that false teachers will emerge, and their fruit will be rotten.  So don’t be shocked; be prepared.

One of the ways they call their readers to be prepared is by describing some of the __flawed doctrine__ these scoffers hold.  We can sum it up this way:  in 2nd Peter, the false teachers say “It doesn’t matter what we do because Jesus isn’t coming back.”  Look at 2 Pet. 3:4:  “_They will say, ‘Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation._”  And it’s similar in Jude.  Here the false teachers say “It doesn’t matter what we do because God’s a God of grace!”  Look at Jude v. 4, starting in the middle of the verse, he refers to these false teachers as: “_Ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ._”

We saw in the letter of Galatians that one of the false teachings that can cripple the church is legalism – the idea that we have to earn our standing in God’s sight by obeying his law.  But in these two letters, we’re on the other side of the spectrum.  Here, we’re dealing with __antinomianism__ – literally, _anti_, “against,” _nomos_, “law.”  These false teachers twist the Gospel so that God’s grace is not about us being forgiven so we can please God; it’s about God not caring so we can please ourselves.  

But the main way Peter and Jude call their readers to be prepared is by describing the __godless lifestyle__ of these teachers.  Just as Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount:  “Watch out for false prophets.  They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.  By their fruit you will recognize them.”[^4]  What kind of fruit do these teachers have?

- For one, they __reject authority__.  2 Pet. 2:10:  _Especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority. Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones._”
- Second, they __embrace immorality__.  2 Pet. 2:13-14:  _Suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you. They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!_
- And third, they __serve only themselves__.  Turn over to Jude vv. 12 and 16:  “_These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves..._” [Verse 16:] "_These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage_".

These guys are like fake doctors who promise healing when they only want the money.

What are we called to do in __response__?  Look at Jude 3:  “_Beloved, although I was eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints._” __Contend for the faith__.  2 Pet. 3:17 says “_Take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability._”  In other words, defend the truth of the Gospel against those who teach it wrongly, and live in obedience that provides a stark contrast with the lifestyle of those who rebel against Christ.  Now, this doesn’t mean we should spend all day writing angry blog posts or turn every spiritual conversation into an argument.  What it means is that we should know the truth, love the truth, and stand for truth even when it goes against the grain.  

For us, today, especially thinking about falsehood that slips in under Christian label, there is a whole host of unbiblical teaching that we need to be aware of and contend against.  On the one hand, you’ve got groups like Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormons that deny truth about Jesus, on the other you have the prosperity Gospel that misunderstands who God is and how he works.  There’s theologically liberal Protestantism that rejects the bodily resurrection of Christ, and then there are those who may believe in Jesus but also discard key doctrines like the atonement, hell, and the idea that God knows the future.  All of this means that we should do what Jude v. 20 says and build ourselves up in the most holy faith – making sure that we know the Gospel, we know the Word, and we’re sitting under faithful teaching.  

But in contending for the faith, we also need to know that it’s not our job ultimately to defeat false teachers.  That’s God’s role.  And that leads us to our fourth and final theme,

### D. The Certainty of God’s Judgment

Right now, we can only see the fruit.  But God knows the heart.  

And so Jude says in v. 14:  “’Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousand of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.’”  

What’s even more tragic is that the false teachers don’t realize this judgment is coming.  In fact, as we saw in 2 Pet. 3:4, they mock the idea that Jesus would ever return.  

Why is it wrong to think God will never judge?  Peter gives 2 reasons: First, time is completely different for God.  Look at 2 Pet. 3:8: “_With the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day._” Second, the fact that God hasn’t judged yet doesn’t mean he never will.  In fact, the reason judgment hasn’t come yet is because he is merciful.  3:9, “_The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance_.”

But when God does judge, it will come suddenly.  3:10, “But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.”

But false teachers aren’t the only ones who will face God’s judgment; we will, too. And when we face God on that day, our teachers won’t be standing beside us.  Each of us will someday give account for how we have used the lives God gave us.  It may be a useful exercise this week to look through the passages in these books that describe the false teachers, and reflect on the fact that without the grace of Jesus – the false teachers would be us.  Selfish, lustful, manipulative, grumblers and faultfinders... 2  Pet. 2:19, “slaves of corruption.”  We should be in shock and awe at the great, painful judgment that awaits false teachers.  But we should be in even more shock and awe that Jesus took every ounce of the destruction we deserve, for all who would repent and believe.

Since God is indeed coming to judge the whole universe, how should we live?  2 Peter has a couple of instructions for us:

- First, __Pursue holiness__.  2 Pet. 3:11-12:  “_Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God._”  Don’t live as if God doesn’t care.  Don’t take his patience as license to sin.  We can ask ourselves, in moments of temptation:  “On the day of God, will I be happy that I indulged this sin?”  Pursue holiness.
- Second, __Look forward__.  2 Pet. 3:13:  “_But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells._” What will that new heaven and new earth be like?  A home of righteousness where wrong, and injustice, and rebellion are vanquished.  Why would we not long for such a place?  And God has given us his Word so that we can know something of this new heaven and new earth – the books of Thessalonians and Revelation that we’ll be studying in the next few weeks will point our gaze to that day.  We can meditate on heaven.  It’s kind of like a travel guidebook – I love these things, if I’m going somewhere where I haven’t been, I grab the guidebook from the library, look at the pictures, imagine the streets, anticipate the taste of the food – I love meditating on where I’m going.  Of course, when I get there, usually it’s much better than I ever imagined.  Brothers and sisters, how much more will heaven exceed every meditation and anticipation of our hearts.   We should meditate on heaven.

That’s what 2 Peter and Jude call us to do – to look forward to that day when we will see Christ face to face.

## Conclusion

In many ways, reading 2 Peter and Jude is like stepping out into the winter air.   These books confront us with the cold reality of false teaching and the calling for us to brace ourselves and contend for the faith.  It’s enough to leave us feeling a bit scared and inadequate, if we’re honest.  But these authors do not want us to be without hope.  In the end, we can be certain of our call – we can be certain of God’s Word – we can be certain that false teachers’ bad fruit will be recognizable – and we can be certain that God himself will judge.  And we can be certain that in the midst of all, God will sustain us and keep us until the end.  So listen to how Jude closes his letter and let’s take comfort in the reality that this is the God that we serve:

> 24Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before his presence with great joy, 25to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.
