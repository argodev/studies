# Ephesians
_"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."_ That’s 
how Paul opens this letter. Grace, *charis*[^1], the traditional Greek greeting. 
And Peace, *shalom*, the Jewish greeting.

And in 6:23-24, he ends the letter in the same way: Shalom *and* Charis. Peace 
and Grace. Jewish and Greek. In so many ways, that is the message of 
Ephesians. It is a letter about the grace of God that brings peace between man 
and God and between brothers in Christ. If you’ll turn with me to Eph. 2:14, 
we’ll see this central message: Paul writes, _"For he is our peace, who made 
both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In his flesh, he 
made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, 
so that he might create in himself one new man from the two, resulting in 
peace."_ God’s grace reconciles those who believe to God – on the vertical axis, 
we were God’s enemies, but now we’re his friends, adopted as sons; and God’s 
grace unites Jew and Gentile, so that all who trust him are no longer strangers, 
but, on the horizontal axis – we’re fellow citizens in God’s kingdom, brothers 
in Christ.

The message of Ephesians can be summed up in one simple sentence: “You have 
received supernatural grace for the glory of God, therefore, live in 
supernatural *unity* to the glory of God.” Grace and peace.

## Purpose and Background

So, let’s turn to purpose and background. Why was this letter written? Unlike 
most of Paul’s letters, it wasn’t written in response to specific problems in 
the church. Instead, it is a very general book. So general, in fact, that it’s 
not even clear that it was written specifically to the Ephesians at all. In 
most of your Bibles, you’ll see a footnote next to the word “Ephesus” in 1:1 
saying that in many early manuscripts, the letter just says, “To the saints 
(blank), the faithful in Christ Jesus.” It appears that this may have been 
intended for broad distribution, written to all the churches Paul had seen 
planted in the region of Ephesus during his nearly three-year stay there. 

Paul likely wrote this around 60AD, roughly 6 years after he left Ephesus, while 
he is in prison in Rome (3:1, 4:1). And it is a glorious work of the Holy 
Spirit. Let’s dive in.

## Overview

Though we won’t step through it, you’ll see an outline of the book on the back 
of your handout. The main thing to notice there is how the book cleanly divides 
into two major sections -- Chapters 1-3, where unity is described as an 
accomplished fact, and then chapter 4-6 where unity is seen as a goal. In other 
words, the book first describes unity as having been already accomplished by 
God, and then calls Christians to work toward the unity that’s not yet complete. 

By way of an overview, I’ll summarize the first half of the book using the 
little paragraphs that you see under each point throughout your handout. 

Praise be to God who predestined us to be redeemed through Christ, to the praise 
of his glorious grace. I thank God and pray for you, that you may know Christ 
better as well as his power for you. (1:1-23) As for us, we were all dead in 
our sins, but God graciously made us alive to show his grace and end our 
boasting. (2:1-10) As a result, God has destroyed the barrier between Jew and 
Gentile, building them into a single building in which God lives by his Spirit. 
(2:11-22) This is the mystery of which I am a herald and for which I am now 
suffering. (3:1-13) So I pray for the supernatural power of God to work this 
kind of unity in you. (3:14-21)

Stopping there, let’s take a deeper look at the first half of the book, chapters 
1-3.

## Chapter 1: God Elects

> Praise be to God who predestined us to be redeemed through Christ, to the 
> praise of his glorious grace. I thank God and pray for you, that you may know 
> Christ better as well as his power for you.[^2]

In the first part of chapter 1, Paul praises God for electing sinners to 
redemption in Christ. Let’s look at 1:3-4: _“Blessed is the God and Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the 
heavens in Christ. For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, 
to be holy and blameless in love before him.”_ And then Paul goes on to describe 
these spiritual blessings: God predestined us, he adopted us as sons, he 
redeemed us through the blood of Christ, he forgave our sins, he revealed his 
will to us. As Paul understands it, our salvation is no “right” that we possess 
by virtue of birth, goodness, or anything else. Election is a privilege we are 
given because of God’s great overflowing love for us in Christ. The language 
here is stunning. The riches of God’s grace that he “lavished” on us with all 
wisdom and understanding. Salvation is nothing that we deserved, but entirely 
God’s choosing. Some people think that the idea of God electing or choosing 
people to know him – even before the creation of the world, as it says in verse 
3 – is inherently impersonal, transacational. But this letter says that 
couldn’t be further from the truth: verses 4 and 5, _“For he chose us in him, 
before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. 
He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, 
according to the good pleasure of his will”_ It’s because of God’s great love 
that sinners like us could become part of his family. 

If that is how much God has loved us, we should long to know God more. The 
creator of the universe has loved his people from all eternity – why would we 
not want to seek him?! And that’s exactly what Paul prays for these Christians 
in 1:15-23. 1:16: _“I never stop giving thanks for you as I remember you in my 
prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, 
would give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.”_ 
May that be the longing and prayer of our hearts too. Moving on to our next 
section,

## 2:1-10: Election Based Purely on Grace

> As for us, we were all dead in our sins, but God graciously made us alive to 
> show his grace and end our boasting.

In chapter one, we considered the gospel from the perspective of God’s electing 
grace. And now we come to chapter two, where Paul shifts the perspective upside 
down; we’ve seen it from God’s eyes, now, in 2:1, he says “And you were 
dead...”

What about us? We were “*dead* in [our] trespasses and sins.” At root we are 
co-conspirators against God and his sovereignty over his own creation. And so, 
under his good judgment against us as sinners we are dead. “But”, you see in 
verse four, “God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love that he had 
for us... made us alive with Christ – You are saved by grace!”

These verses constitute one of the most glorious portrayals of our salvation in 
all of Scripture. They make it clear that we can never make ourselves right 
with God through enough good works. In fact, the question isn’t whether our 
good works will outweigh our bad: it’s are we spiritually alive, or spiritually 
dead? God must make us spiritually alive, so that we can repent of our sin and 
put our faith in Christ. Then, as Paul says in verse 10 -- having been saved 
totally by grace, responding to God in faith – then we can do the good works God 
prepared in advance for us to do – not in order to be saved, but because we’ve 
already been saved.

What kind of good works does Paul have in mind? Move ahead to our next section, 
where we see that:

## 2:11-3:13: The Primary Application of the Gospel is Unity

> As a result, God has destroyed the barrier between Jew and Gentile, building 
> them into a single building in which God lives by his Spirit. This is the 
> mystery of which I am a herald and for which I am now suffering.

Paul begins with background: the Gentiles were at one time _"without Christ, 
excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of 
promise, without hope and without God in the world."_ (2:12). But what happened? 
Verse 14: Jesus _"is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the 
dividing wall of hostility."_ What’s that dividing wall? Most literally, the 
wall that divided the court of the Jews from the court of the Gentiles in the 
temple. The gospel has made peace between Jew and Gentile, and between them and 
God.

Paul then continues this thought into chapter 3, calling this a “mystery.” Not 
a mystery as in something hard to understand, but something impossible to 
understand until Jesus revealed it to us. What is this mystery? Paul states in 
plainly in verse 6. _"The Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body, and 
partners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel."_

What’s going on here? From the time of Abraham on, God’s people were defined 
ethnically. That’s why Abraham’s descendants were prohibited from marrying with 
the nations around them. But suddenly, that wall has been destroyed. We are 
not saved, as we saw at the beginning of Chapter 2, based on our good works or 
our family tree — but based on the grace of God alone. So the kingdom of God 
has now been extended to all peoples.

This idea of peace and unity between Jews and Gentiles is *the* central 
application of Ephesians. Paul goes so far in verse 8 to state that preaching 
this unity was his mission. _"This grace was given to me—the least of all the 
saints—to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ, and to 
shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in 
God who created all things."_ Again, what is the mystery? Verse 6: Jews and 
Gentiles together in the church. Unity is the primary application of the gospel. 
The central calling of Paul’s ministry. And, verse 10 says that this unity is 
central to God’s plan to bring glory to himself. It reads, _"so that God’s 
multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and 
authorities in the heavens."_

So if you’ve ever thought of unity in the church as being icing on the cake, 
something nice but not that important, we should think again. Paul makes unity 
as fundamental to the application of the gospel as he could possibly express. 
But, the necessity of the gospel message we heard in chapters 1 and 2 to create 
real unity is striking. Sometimes, especially in theologically liberal 
traditions, when individuals increasingly set aside the belief that Scripture is 
inspired by God and begin thinking instead that truth is discovered through 
one’s own subjective conclusions, they often begin emphasizing unity. Unity 
becomes an end in and of itself: the idea of folks from all races and 
backgrounds together in a loving community. But at the end of the day, unity 
doesn’t work unless something substantial actually unites you -- not just the 
idea of unity, but something so powerful that it really could join together all 
sorts of different people. 

Ironically, it’s the true gospel that brings this kind of real unity. When we 
affirm that we are all depraved, that we are all dead spiritually, that we are 
in debt to God, that Christ is our only hope, a strange, helpless unity comes 
over us. A group of admittedly sinful people has nothing to brag about. So it 
is not surprising when the world’s most familiar barriers to unity are brought 
down in churches that are not focused on bringing them down but are focused 
instead on teaching the gospel faithfully and clearly. That’s real unity – that 
kind of bond that as 2:19 says comes from being “saints and members of God's 
household.” And having established that that is the unity that God has created 
in the church, Paul moves in 3:14-21 to prayer...

## 3:14-21: Prayer for the Supernatural

> So I pray for the supernatural power of God to work this kind of unity in you. 

Does Paul realize that the unity he’s described is humanly impossible? I think 
he does. That’s why he prays as he does in verses 14 through 21.

There are two things Paul prays for here. First, v. 16 & 17, _"that he may 
grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power 
in your inner being through his Spirit and that Christ may dwell in your hearts 
through faith"_ In other words, that through his Spirit God would give you the 
supernatural faith you need to accomplish this supernatural unity. And second, 
_"that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to 
comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of 
God’s love, and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge"_. Why pray that 
we would know the full extent of Christ’s love for us? Because that is what 
powers our love. _"We love because he first loved us."_ (1 John 4:19)

How are Jews to love Gentiles? And how are we to love those in our own church 
with whom we have nothing in common but Christ? Pray that we would comprehend 
the supernatural love He has shown us. That will empower supernatural love for 
him and for each other.

And so it makes sense that Paul ends with his doxology, his praise, to the God 
who can do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power 
that is at work within us. How do we pray for the supernatural to happen? We 
can use these verses as a blueprint, praying that his Spirit would give us 
supernatural faith, and that we would understand the supernatural love Christ 
has shown us in the gospel, so that we in turn might love with supernatural 
power.

## Why God Has Done This

Before we exit this first half of the book, though, I want to point out 
something I’ve skipped over. Perhaps nowhere else in Scripture do we see such a 
concise description not just of what God has done but why. Why did God create 
the world? Why did he reconcile us to himself in grace and grant us peace with 
one another in the church? Let me retrace our steps so far, and introduce you 
to three reasons behind God’s purposes.

### First, God has done all this For the Praise of His Grace

Look back at chapter 1, verse 5. _"he predestined us for adoption as sons 
through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will."_ 
Why? Because we’re so wonderful? No. Verse 6: _"to the praise of his glorious 
grace."_ And similarly in verse 11, _"In him we have also received an 
inheritance, because we were predestined according to the plan of the one who 
works out everything in agreement with the purpose of his will, so that we who 
had already put our hope in Christ might bring praise to his glory."_ God did 
these things to showcase the immensity of his grace. 

That’s what we see again in 2:7. Why did God raise us from being spiritually 
dead? _"so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of 
his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus."_

### For the Praise of His Wisdom

But there is a second answer to the question “why.” It’s for the praise of his 
wisdom. Look at 3:10. Paul is explaining his calling to preach the gospel so 
that Jews and Gentiles might be united in Christ. He says, _"This is so that 
God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the 
rulers and authorities in the heavens."_ Why is church such an uncomfortable 
place to be sometimes? Because these are people with whom you have nothing in 
common but Jesus. But that’s exactly God’s plan. When we are able to love each 
other supernaturally, it makes such a statement about God’s wisdom in creating 
the church that even beings outside our physical world sit up and take notice. 
The church is the crown jewel that displays God’s infinite wisdom to the whole 
cosmos!

### For the Glory of God

And there is a third answer — it somewhat encompasses the other two. God did 
all this for his own glory. Look at 3:20-21. _"Now to him who is able to do 
above and beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works in 
us—to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever 
and ever. Amen."_

God will be glorified forever in the way we his people are redeemed, in the way 
we live it out, and in the way we will forever be his. God has decided to bring 
glory to himself through our redemption — we who are sinners! Isn’t this 
amazing! The all-powerful God of the universe chooses to glorify himself 
through us, his church. We display the character of God to his creation, and so 
we bring him glory. That’s God’s purpose for all that he does, and that is the 
driving force behind this first half of Ephesians. ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?

## Intro to Second Half

And that takes us to chapter 4. Thus far, the letter has been entirely 
descriptive. God has chosen us. He has rescued us from death. He has 
destroyed the wall between Jew and Gentile. But starting in chapter 4, Paul’s 
language turns from the indicative to the imperative. Verse 1: _"Therefore I, 
the prisoner in the Lord, urge you to live worthy of the calling you have 
received."_ Just like we did with the first three chapters, let me summarize 
what we see here in the last three; again, you’ll see this summary in your 
handout.

Keep the unity of the Spirit required by your new lives in Christ; (4:1-6) to 
accomplish this, God has given us gifts to build unity. (4:7-16) So you must 
no longer live as godless Gentiles. Instead, speak the truth, building each 
other up and forgiving just as Christ forgave you. (4:17-5:2) Don’t 
misunderstand me, however, I am not telling you to have unity with those who lie 
and say that immorality is okay. (5:3-14) Instead, make the most of every 
opportunity (5:15-20), submitting to each other in the following ways: (5:21) 
Wives, submit to your husbands; husbands love your wives as Christ did the 
church. (5:22-32). Children, obey your parents; fathers, bring your children up 
in the training of the Lord. (6:1-4) Slaves, obey your earthly masters; 
masters, treat your slaves with respect and fear since you serve the same 
master. (6:5-9) Finally, put on the full armor of God so that you can continue 
to stand, praying even for me, that I might continue to stand. (6:10-20). So 
first,

## 4:1-5:2: Build One Another Up

> Keep the unity of the Spirit required by your new lives in Christ; to 
> accomplish this, God has given us gifts to build unity. So you must no longer 
> live as godless Gentiles. Instead, speak the truth, building each other up 
> and forgiving just as Christ forgave you.

Now that we’re firmly in the application section of this epistle, it becomes 
critical to tie these commands back to the first three chapters of the book. 
Chapter 4, verses 1-3 is, in a sense, a summary of how we should live based on 
all we’ve discussed in chapters 1-3, and thus it’s also a summary of the 
challenge that chapters 4-6 set out to address. _"Therefore I, the prisoner in 
the Lord, urge you to live worthy of the calling you have received, with all 
humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making 
every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."_

All of the admonitions in Ephesians 4-6 are answering the question _"how can we 
keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace?"_ in a congregation so 
diverse that it even encompasses Jews and Gentiles.

Chapter 4 answers this challenge very practically.

### Gifts

For starters, we use the gifts that Christ has given us — apostles, prophets, 
evangelists, pastors, and teachers. (4:11) As with every other examination of 
Spiritual gifts in his letters, Paul makes it clear that the goal of gifts is 
the unity of the church, not our own personal fulfillment. We so often think 
that we have received gifts, and must use gifts, in order to be fulfilled as 
individuals. Paul writes that gifts are given the church _"to build up the body 
of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s 
Son..."_(4:12b-13) And notice what the result is when those gifts are put to 
use to guard the unity of the church. Orthodoxy, sound doctrine. Verse 14: 
_"Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown 
around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the 
techniques of deceit."_ As Bible-believing evangelicals, we often think of unity 
as a goal that, if pursued, might compromise what we believe. But in fact, when 
we pursue unity founded on the gospel as God intends, that unity is what 
protects us from compromising our doctrine.

### Wisdom

Next, Paul says that unity in the church depends on us living in wisdom. When 
we were spiritually dead, he says in verse 18, we were _"darkened"_ in our 
understanding and separated from God because of the ignorance in our hardened 
hearts. Now, though, we are called to put off the old self with its evil 
desires, and, verse 23, to _"be renewed in the spirit of your minds."_ Paul is 
telling us that fleeing sin and living in godliness starts with our minds. If 
we pay attention to God’s wisdom rather than the fleeting desires of the flesh, 
we will grow in righteousness and the church will grow in unity.

### Speech

The next thing we see in this passage is that we can use our speech to build 
each other up. We are not to lie (v. 25), speak in sinful anger (v. 26), or use 
unwholesome talk (v. 29) but speak in ways that build others up. And we are to 
forgive each other as Christ forgave us. (v. 32)

### Money

And we can build each other up with our finances as well. Verse 28 is a great, 
and humbling, purpose statement for your work: _"Let the thief no longer steal. 
Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to 
share with anyone in need."_ If you’ve ever thought that being motivated by 
earning money when you work is necessarily vulgar and ungodly, I’d encourage you 
to spend some time with this verse. Money can be a good and Godly motivation 
for work. But Paul moves on from these encouragements to a section of caution:

## 5:3-14: Do Not Partner with Darkness

> Don’t misunderstand me, however, I am not telling you to have unity with those 
> who lie and say that immorality is okay.

Now we get to chapter 5, when Paul’s tone turns from encouragement to warning. 
Verses 5-7: _"For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral or impure or 
greedy person, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom 
of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God’s 
wrath is coming on the disobedient because of these things. Therefore, do not 
become their partners."_ (5:5-7)

Wow! Quite a shift from love and forgiveness. What’s going on here? In a 
letter about gospel unity, Paul takes time to warn us about a __wrong kind__ of 
unity. A congregation should never seek unity in diversity if it means 
tolerance for greed, impurity, impropriety, or immorality. God’s people are to 
separate themselves from such things.

Christians are to run to each other with open arms, regardless of background or 
nationality. But the severity of Paul’s language is indicative of how strongly 
we must also oppose any attempt to force unity where the gospel is not the 
ground of our friendship.

## 5:15-6:9: Make the Most of Every Opportunity

> Instead, make the most of every opportunity, submitting to each other in the 
> following ways: Wives, submit to your husbands; husbands love your wives as 
> Christ did the church. Children, obey your parents; fathers, bring your 
> children up in the training of the Lord. Slaves, obey your earthly masters; 
> masters, treat your slaves with respect and fear since you serve the same 
> master.

With that caveat behind us, Paul returns to answering the challenge he laid out 
in 4:3 — how can we keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace? 
What he writes in the next few paragraphs might surprise you.

We should seek unity by living wisely, _"making the most of the time"_ as he 
says in 5:16. That means being filled with the Spirit in verse 18, encouraging 
each other through song in verse 19. And, most significantly, we are to make 
the most of every opportunity in our homes and workplaces as well, which is 
where Paul turns in the next verses by exhorting the Ephesians to _"[Submit] to 
one another in the fear of [out of reverance for] Christ."_ (5:21) The 
remainder of chapter 5 and beginning of chapter 6 are specific ways in which we 
must submit to each other.

These passages are likely familiar to most of you. 5:22-33 contains profound 
teaching on marriage, viewing marriage as designed to image Christ’s love for 
his church. In chapter 6 is teaching on relationships between children and 
parents, and between slaves and their masters. We certainly should note that 
when Paul tells wives to submit to their husbands and for husbands to 
sacrificially love their wives, he’s speaking about how the distinct, 
complementary roles that God has ordained for men and women in marriage provide 
a picture of Christ’s relationship to the church. All throughout Paul’s 
writings and the whole Bible, it’s clear that men and women have equal dignity, 
value, and worth but complementary roles in the home and in the church. We 
could spend all day on this or on any number of other issues that this section 
raises, but where I want to focus is what we learn when we put these passages 
into their overall context.

The first thing to notice is that this idea of headship and submission is under 
the larger point of _"making the most of the time"_ from 5:16. Have you ever 
thought of submission in that category? Not as an inconvenient or difficult to 
understand burden — but God’s design for how we might make the most of this life 
for his glory. And then moving to the larger context — these commands sit 
 within a book on how the gospel drives unity in the church between those who 
 have nothing in common but Christ. What this means is that your marriage 
 matters for more than just its own sake. It images Christ’s love for his 
 church, his body. And when roles of husband and wife are attended to, your 
 marriage contributes to unity within God’s new society of the church. So, 
 marriage is far more profound than merely a bond between two people – it’s one 
 of the ways that God pictures his love for us, and therefore it’s one of the 
 ways that God builds unity in his church.

## 6:10-23: Stand to the End

> Finally, put on the full armor of God so that you can continue to stand, 
> praying even for me, that I might continue to stand.

And that brings us to the famous section on spiritual warfare in 6:10. 
Remember, that’s where we began this section. The end of chapter 3 is a prayer 
for the supernatural to happen; chapter 6 ends with a description of the 
 supernatural at work. But now the call is a broader one — the call to stand. 
 Paul repeats that word four times. So if you read through chapter 6, expect 
 Paul to stare you in the eye and tell you to “Stand! Stand! Stand!.” Not an 
 easy thing to do. If you reach the end of your days on earth and can say that 
 you have stood fast, what an accomplishment to the glory of God! And so Paul 
 tells the Ephesians to put on the whole armor of God. To be strong in the 
 Lord.

And so how appropriate are his last words of instruction: _"Take the helmet of 
salvation and the sword of the Spirit— which is the word of God. Pray at all 
times in the Spirit with every prayer and request, and stay alert with all 
perseverance and intercession for all the saints. Pray also for me, that the 
message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the 
mystery of the gospel."_ (6:17-19)

Now doesn’t that get your heart? There is Paul in prison, an old man, praying 
and asking others to pray that God would make him fearless. Paul knew courage 
was needed to continue, and so he asked for it. And that is where this book on 
the unity that comes from the gospel concludes: with Paul desiring to continue 
to preach this gospel, so that the unity of the church might continue to grow. 

ANY QUESTIONS?

# Colossians: New Life In Christ

Unlike the letter to the Ephesians, Paul wrote his letter to the Colossian 
Christians to counter a very specific heresy. It seems that some were teaching 
these young Christians that life and wisdom were found through the powers of our 
own human faculties. In chapter 2:8 we read, _"Be careful that no one takes you 
captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition, based on 
the elements of the world, rather than Christ."_

At the heart of much of this false teaching was the idea that the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is a great start, but there is so much more on offer. That is, 
Jesus is the beginning, but there are other ways to receive _"fullness"_ in the 
Christian life. This was to be received by specially-revealed wisdom, perhaps 
with particular understanding of the Jewish law, and perhaps through angelic 
encounters.

This is a three-pronged attack on the sufficiency of Jesus Christ.

- Judaizing and Gnostic tendencies deny the finality of Christ’s work.
- Their preoccupation with angelic experiences denies the preeminence of Christ.
- And asceticism denies our need for Christ.

In response, Paul wrote to remind them that the life of the Kingdom is found 
ultimately in Christ, and Christ alone. In Christ we find new life. Through 
Christ’s death we die to our old lives, and through his life we are given new 
life. Our new lives are characterized by transformed relationships with God and 
with others. And as a result, the life of the Kingdom is a cross-centered life. 

But before we dive into to the letter itself, a little background.

## Background & Date

It seems that Paul wrote and sent Ephesians and Colossians together. There is 
considerable overlap between the two letters, and Paul mentions Tychicus at the 
end of both letters as the one who likely delivered them. If you were to read 
the two letters back to back, you would likely get the distinct impression that 
Ephesians was the general letter (you’ll recall it was likely written as a 
circular letter to a whole group of churches in Asia Minor), while Colossians 
deals with many of the same themes but was addressed to the needs of one 
particular church. Unlike Ephesus, Paul never visited Colossae, even though it 
was only 100 miles east of Ephesus. Nevertheless, he had been instrumental in 
that church’s founding, through the conversion of Epaphras, who he then sent 
with the gospel to Colossae. Like the letter to the Ephesians, it appears that 
Paul wrote this while in prison in Rome, around 60AD. (4:3, 10, 18).

## Outline

So then, what do we find in this letter? Well, not surprising given its audience 
of a particular church, the letter begins with a fairly lengthy introduction 
that focuses on Paul’s aim for this (and every) church is that we _"may walk 
worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and 
growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power, according to 
his glorious might, so that you may have great endurance and patience, joyfully 
giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the saints’ 
inheritance in the light."_ (1:10-12). Quite a run-on sentence, but quite an 
amazing picture of our objective in this Christian life.

From there, Paul steps right into the meat of his letter with one of the most 
amazing portraits of Christ that we find anywhere in Scripture. _"He is the 
image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."_ (1:15) and on 
from there through verse 20 of chapter one. From there, Paul turns his attention 
to the primary implication of who Christ is for the Colossians: their 
reconciliation with God that you see in 1:21 through verse 23. These two truths: 
who Christ is, and who we are as a result, are the theological core of this 
book. And Paul steps back for a moment, 1:24-2:3, to consider his own work to 
support those great truths.

Then, beginning in 2:4 on through the end of chapter 2, we see the alternative 
that has been placed in front of these Christians. It stems from _"philosophy 
and empty deceit based on human tradition, based on the elements of the world, 
rather than Christ."_ (verse 8). Paul pauses for a moment to remind us 
(beautifully) of the gospel, and then continues describing this false teaching 
in verse 16. It is consumed with tradition — religious festivals, new moon 
celebrations, Sabbath days. It delights in false humility (verse 18) and the 
worship of angels and a celebration of that mystical experience. It is ascetic, 
imposing strict rules on the body (verses 20-23). Tellingly, Paul observes, 
verse 23, that _"Although these have a reputation for wisdom by promoting 
self-made religion, false humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are 
not of any value in curbing self-indulgence."_ A very good litmus test for 
evaluating different strands of teaching in our own day.

And then Paul turns, in chapter 3, to how we should live as Christians — the 
implications of the true gospel that do in fact result in changed lives, in real 
restraint of sensual indulgence. He covers how we should live together in 
holiness, how our families should function, and how we should behave toward 
others in the broader community. And then, with another round of personal 
greetings, Paul ends his letter with chapter four.

## Major Themes

Now, with that as an overview, I’d like to turn this letter over thematically 
and try to parse out its primary message to us.

How exactly does Paul address the false teaching that is threatening to turn the 
Colossians away from Christ to the wisdom of this world? Two big things that I 
want you to notice.

### 1. First, the Christian’s new life comes from God through Christ alone

In Christ we have received new life. Before (2:13) _"you were dead in 
trespasses"_ but now _"he made you alive with him and forgave us all our 
trespasses."_ Before (3:1-4) your minds were set on _"earthly things"_ but now 
your minds and hearts are set _"the things above."_ Before (2:21) we lived life 
as enemies of God, alienated from him, but now, we live _"worthy of the Lord"_ 
(1:10). This new life changes the way we relate to God and to other people. But 
if we jump straight into how we should live and forget the source of that — that 
 our new life comes from God — we will find ourselves lined up squarely with 
 these false teachers preaching a gospel based on our own strength, derived 
 from our own wisdom and traditions, that — in the end — is powerless against 
 the sinfulness of our own hearts. 

### 2. And second, the Christian’s new life is displayed in relationships with 
other people

As a result of the cross, not human wisdom, Christians’ lives are changed. It 
may be that your mind used to be set on partying on the weekend, or expanding 
your portfolio, or just making sure that no one messed with you. Now think about 
what your priories are: loving others sacrificially, spreading the gospel, 
pleasing God.

Let’s look at these two main points in more detail.

## A. From God

First, our new life is a gift from God. Paul thanks God for the Colossians’ 
faith, knowing that God is the author of it (1:3). He prays: _"giving thanks to 
the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in 
light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the 
kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of 
sins."_ (1:12-14) In his prayer he acknowledges that God rescues, strengthens, 
qualifies, and redeems us.

Let’s note two things about God’s gift of new life to us. First, God gives us 
this new life through Christ. _"For the entire fullness of God’s nature dwells 
bodily in Christ"_ Paul writes (2:9). _"you were dead in trespasses... he made 
you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses."_ (2:13) Christ is the 
source of our life and his death and resurrection is the means by which God 
applies that life to us. Paul writes _"For you died, and your life is hidden 
with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will 
appear with him in glory."_ (3:3-4) This is what baptism symbolizes, and why 
baptism is the public sign of our profession of faith. Paul writes, _"You were 
also circumcised in him with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off 
the body of flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, when you were buried with him 
in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working 
of God, who raised him from the dead."_ (2:11-12) Incidentally, Colossians is 
one of the clearest places in the New Testament where we understand what baptism 
means. Often, people have suggested that baptism is a continuation of the 
covenant of circumcision in the Old Testament — and thus should be applied to 
our children even before they are saved. And sure enough, in 2:11-12, Paul does 
indeed parallel baptism with circumcision. But he takes pains to show that the 
circumcision he is referring to is not physical circumcision _"done with hands"_ 
but circumcision of the __heart__. And just as circumcision of the heart was a 
reference to faith in the Old Testament, so baptism today is only for those who 
have experienced that same faith.

Second, if God gives us this new life through Christ, we should also note that 
God gives us this new life through Christ alone. No other person, achievement, 
idea, or human effort will avail us. And this idea of salvation through Christ 
alone is critical as Paul defends the gospel from these false teachers. Paul 
calls Christ _"God’s mystery... in him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom 
and knowledge."_ (2:2-3). To that end Paul warns the Colossians not to be 
deceived or taken captive _"with arguments that sound reasonable."_ (2:4), 
_"philosophy and empty deceit,"_ or _"human tradition,"_ (2:8). The Colossians 
evidently were being led astray by relying on ritual, asceticism, angel worship, 
and fashionable philosophy. _"Therefore, don’t let anyone judge you in regard to 
food and drink or in the matter of a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day... 
Let no one condemn you by delighting in ascetic practices and the worship of 
angels, claiming access to a visionary realm."_ (2:16, 18). These are serious 
temptations. As I read earlier, Paul acknowledges that _"Although these have a 
reputation for wisdom by promoting self-made religion, false humility, and 
severe treatment of the body,"_ but ultimately _"they are not of any value in 
curbing self-indulgence."_ (2:22-23).

Beware of Christianity *plus* something else. Christianity — with a dash of 
Buddhism. Christianity and a daily regime of meditation and exercise. 
Christianity modernized with New Age sensibility. Christianity made 
intellectually respectable with Plato or Aristotle. Christianity made easy with 
a fixed calendar of prayers and recitations and scented candles. There are a lot 
of formulas for how to augment the Bible with something else. Lots of Christians 
feel the pull to mix their faith with something else, whether it is philosophy, 
asceticism, other religions, or elaborate ceremonies and rituals. The problem is 
that the something else ends up becoming more important and conflicting with 
fundamental truths of Scripture. The book of Colossians is a good place to go to 
reflect on the sufficiency and supremacy of God’s work in Christ — and the 
resulting simplicity of the Christian faith.

There isn’t anything wrong with simply studying other world religions or 
philosophy. Such study can help us become better evangelists and apologists for 
the faith. And there is nothing wrong with participating in shared corporate 
worship — that will over time, develop its own habits and characteristics. But 
these things should never become substitutes for Christ, or even necessary 
additions to Christ. We can change our rituals and still worship God. We can go 
our entire Christians lives without an angelic encounter or even a dramatic 
spiritual “experience” and still be faithful. We can become perfectly 
knowledgeable about the faith without studying the philosophers’ commentaries on 
it. Paul strongly cautions the Colossians always to remember that Christ alone 
is fully sufficient to bring us to “fullness” and to give us “new life.” In fact 
Paul gives one of the strongest statements of Christ’s supremacy and sufficiency 
in all Scripture in 1:15-20:

> _He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For 
> everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the 
> invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things 
> have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and by him 
> all things hold together. He is also the head of the body, the church; he is 
> the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have 
> first place in everything. For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell 
> in him, and through him to reconcile everything to himself, whether things on 
> earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the 
> cross._

Nothing can compare with Christ! 

## B. For God and Others

That was the first thing I wanted you to notice: our new life comes from God 
through Christ alone. And the second: this new life is lived for God’s glory and 
according to his purposes. God is not only the source of our new life: God’s 
character is the model for our new life and His will is a guide for our new 
life.

As I mentioned earlier, Paul prays that the Christians in Colossae would live 
_"so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit 
in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with 
all power, according to his glorious might, so that you may have great endurance 
and patience, joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share 
in the saints’ inheritance in the light."_ (1:10-12). Our lives are to be worthy 
of God and pleasing to him, which means that our lives should be marked by 
increasing knowledge about God, thankfulness for all that he has given us, and 
patience with the trials and temptations of this life. Paul reiterates this 
theme in 1:6, where he writes that the truth of the gospel _"that has come to 
you. It is bearing fruit and growing all over the world, just as it has among 
you since the day you heard it and came to truly appreciate_ [or, understand] 
_God’s grace."_

Paul tells the Colossians that their new life in Christ should have real 
implications for how they live their lives and how they treat each other. 
Because _"since you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on 
the new self. You are being renewed in knowledge according to the image of your 
Creator."_ (3:9-10) he expects them to _"put away all the following: anger, 
wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth."_ and _"Do not lie 
to one another"_ (3:8-9). In their new life, they are to live differently. 
_"Therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and dearly loved, put on compassion, 
kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and 
forgiving one another if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the 
Lord has forgiven you, so you are also to forgive. Above all, put on love, which 
is the perfect bond of unity."_ (3:12-14) Our new life starts with a new heart, 
with new attitudes, with a new approach and a new way of thinking about and 
responding to the world.

Practically speaking, this new way of living shows itself in our relationships 
with other people. In chapter 3 Paul gives guidance to different groups of 
people in their key relationships, focusing on the family. _"Wives, submit 
yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your 
wives and don’t be bitter toward them. Children, obey your parents in 
everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not exasperate your children, 
so that they won’t become discouraged."_ (3:18-21). Our new life in Christ 
should be evident first in how we treat our family members. This can be 
especially challenging because our family members are precisely the people we 
often take for granted. It can be tempting to treat one’s home as the place 
where we no longer have to be polite or kind, where we are allowed to 
_relax,_—in other words, let’s be honest, to be selfish with our words and our 
time. But Paul is very specific: the home is where we begin to live our new 
lives. Note that while the roles differ—wife, husband, children—the theme is the 
same: love.

We also live our new lives in the workplace. Paul gives guidance to _slaves_ or 
_bondservants_ which parallels loosely with our concept of _employees_ and to 
_bosses_. _"Slaves, obey your human masters in everything. Don’t work only while 
being watched, as people-pleasers, but work wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord. 
Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and not 
for people, knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the 
 Lord. You serve the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for 
 whatever wrong he has done, and there is no favoritism."_ (3:22-24). Now 
 modern employees in this country typically have far more rights and privileges 
 in the workplace than ancient servants did in theirs. Yet Paul was telling 
 servants in the ancient world to _"obey"_, to _"do it from the heart,"_ and to 
 _"work wholeheartedly."_ If they, with far fewer rewards, were to work with 
 sincerity and hard effort, how much more should we? This can be difficult, 
 because complaining about our jobs is often the entire content of our small 
 talk at parties and lunches. Yet Paul reminds us that we should be grateful to 
 work and should be careful to honor God with or labor. We should eagerly seek 
 to please our employers, genuinely from the heart. We shouldn’t do just enough 
 to get by, or only perform when the boss is watching. I think Paul is saying 
 that we should take pride in our work, even enjoy it! Finally, Paul adds a 
 word for employers. _"Masters, deal with your slaves justly and fairly, since 
 you know that you too have a Master in heaven."_ (4:1)

So our new life should show itself in our relationships with our family, in the 
workplace, and in all of our interactions generally. As Paul is winding down his 
short letter to the Colossians, he counsels them to _"Act wisely toward 
outsiders, making the most of the time. Let your speech always be gracious, 
seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person."_ 
(4:5-6) This new life should simply be a way of life evident in everything we 
do, in all that we say, to every person we meet and with whom we interact.

Because our new life is so important and so all-encompassing, we must strive to 
endure to the end. _"But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through 
his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him—if indeed 
you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the 
hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has been proclaimed in all 
creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become a servant of it."_ (1:22-23). We 
must persevere to the end to receive the fullness of our new lives with him in 
the new creation. That is why Paul prays that the Colossians would have _"great 
endurance and patience, joyfully"_ (1:11). We know that our perseverance is 
guaranteed by God who enables us to live through his Spirit, yet we also see 
here in Colossians that we must strive every day to live out this perseverance.

And all of this, if we understand it correctly, is impossible if we don’t 
understand the Christ and the gospel laid out in the first half of the letter. 
So as you study this book, spend good time considering and meditating on Paul’s 
words in the first chapter. Consider this God-centered, God-powered, 
God-glorifying gospel that we have received, and then — only then — read on and 
contemplate how it should evidence itself in your life.

## C. Conclusion

Paul’s letter to the Colossians teaches us that in Christ we have received new 
life. We are dead to our sins and made alive through him. And Christ alone is 
sufficient for our new lives. He is the _"image of the invisible God"_ in whom 
the fullness of God dwells. Compared to the absolute supremacy of Christ, 
nothing else compares. Sophisticated philosophy, angelic encounters, beautiful 
rituals, ancient traditions, supposedly secret knowledge, New Age spiritualism, 
and anything else simply pales in comparison to Christ the King.

And our new lives bring new relationships. We relate in a fundamentally new way 
to God. We have peace with him, seek to grow in knowledge of him, and obey his 
will for our lives. We relate in a new way as well to our families, friends, 
colleagues, and co-workers. We are no longer marked by _"sexual immorality, 
impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness"_ but by _"compassionate 
hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience."_ And we are called to 
persevere in this new life to the end — with God’s help through his Spirit. That 
is the message of Colossians. Which brings us to Philemon.

# Philemon: Reconciliation

Philemon is the shortest of Paul’s letters. It is also unique in that it is not 
a letter to a church, but to an individual church member. It’s a personal letter 
from Paul on behalf of Philemon's runaway slave Onesimus who served alongside 
Paul (we assume Onesimus became a Christian after he ran away). Paul's 
compassion and love for the young man is apparent when he calls him "my child." 
He has sent him back to ask for forgiveness.

Before we go further, let me say a word about slavery in the NT. To begin with, 
we want to be careful not to read 18th and 19th century race-based chattel 
slavery back into the 1st century. In Paul’s day, though some slavery was the 
result of warfare, most was of an economic kind more akin to indentured 
servanthood. Rome was full of doctors, lawyers and teachers who were slaves And 
it was not based on race. That said, the New Testament never excuses slavery, 
nor exonerates slave holders. It does not try to set up an alternative 
political-economic system. Rather, as Paul does here, it seeks to bring the 
implications of the gospel to bear on both slave and master.

## Outline

2) Thanksgiving and intercession for Philemon (4-7)
3) Paul's plea for Onesimus (8-22)
4) Final remarks (23-25)

## Major Themes and Message

The theme of reconciliation through the power of Christ, the cross-centered 
life, runs throughout the book of Colossians (written to the church attended by 
the recipients of this note). __Reconciliation__ is put into practice in the 
book of Philemon, in a very real way. Paul is asking one man to forgive another 
who has wronged him directly. Both are asked to do something difficult.

*Onesimus is a picture of someone who needs forgiveness.* Paul has sent Onesimus 
back to his employer whom he had wronged. Now Onesimus would turn up at 
Philemon’s house with nothing but a letter from Paul in his hand. Can you 
imagine the former slave standing in the doorway as his former employer opens 
the door — needing forgiveness, helpless to repay, cared for only by someone far 
away in prison. In one sense, the destitution of this former slave is 
incomparable. He can offer nothing, and he deserves punishment. 

Philemon, for his part, may not have found it easy to forgive. *By forgiving 
Onesimus, he might be regarded as showing weakness. He might bring shame upon 
himself among his neighbors for treating a runaway employee, or indentured 
servant, this way. Perhaps he worries that such leniency would encourage 
Onesimus to view his crime lightly. Perhaps it would also encourage others to 
follow Onesimus’s example and let them think they too would get off lightly.* 
Any of you who have exercised authority in the workplace know the tension 
between justice and mercy towards your employees.

Why does Paul make this request? So that the love of Christ and the reconciling, 
redeeming power of the gospel, might be displayed. Paul is a peacemaker, and he 
is pushy about it! Note how Paul goes about pleading with Philemon. Onesimus had 
become a Christian, and so Paul identifies himself closely with Onesimus. 
Onesimus is _"my son,"_ (10) and _"my very own heart,"_ (12) and _"dearly 
beloved brother –especially to me,"_ (16). He even says _"welcome him as you 
would me."_ (17) and offers to pay Onesimus’ debts (18). Paul enters into 
Onesimus’ world and identifies closely with him and his trials. From within 
that position Paul pleads with Philemon not for Onesimus’ sake, but for his own. 
What a picture of what Christ has done for us! When we join ourselves to him, he 
identifies with us and pleads with the Father on our behalf. Paul is simply 
following Christ’s example in seeking reconciliation between two believers.

Paul’s use of the situation offers a model and an example of pastoral 
ministering, counseling, and forgiveness. When confronting someone, appeal to 
the love that they have known in Christ. Have confidence that if you are 
speaking to a Christian then the Lord will work love in them. We don’t need to 
manipulate one another. Just as in Colossians, we can hold out the gospel to one 
another, trusting that it is the only sufficient grounds for transformation.

And Onesimus, for his part, is in the situation we are all in before God. We can 
offer nothing to God. We deserve punishment. And we are desperately in need of 
his forgiveness. We can only imagine how Onesimus must have felt when Paul told 
him he had to return to Philemon, or what it was like to carry that letter back 
to his employer. Do you remember what it was like the first time you realized 
the depth of your sin and the justice of God’s wrath against you? Paul’s little 
letter offers a good opportunity to meditate on that and call it to mind again. 
*We need God’s condescending, self-lowering love in our own lives, offered to us 
only because Christ has met the demands of justice for all who repent and 
believe. We need to be forgiven, and we need to forgive, if we would have true 
Christian faith.*

## Conclusion

What then is the life of the Kingdom? It is a life that from first to last is 
marked by the grace that we have been shown in and through Christ. A grace that 
unites us, a grace that animates us, a grace that has changed us, so that we 
might indeed be a display of the glory of God, and Jesus words might be 
fulfilled, that all men would know that we are his disciples, because of our 
love for one another.
