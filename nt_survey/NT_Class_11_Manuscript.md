# Ephesians

“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”  That’s how Paul opens this letter.  Grace, *charis*[^1], the traditional Greek greeting.  And Peace, *shalom*, the Jewish greeting.

And in 6:23-24, he ends the letter in the same way: Shalom *and* Charis.  Peace and  Grace. Jewish and Greek.  In so many ways, that is the message of Ephesians.  It is a letter about the grace of God that brings peace between man and God and between brothers in Christ.  If you’ll turn with me to Eph. 2:14, we’ll see this central message:  Paul writes, “For he is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In his flesh, he made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, so that he might create in himself one new man from the two, resulting in peace.” God’s grace reconciles those who believe to God – on the vertical axis, we were God’s enemies, but now we’re his friends, adopted as sons;  and God’s grace unites Jew and Gentile, so that all who trust him are no longer strangers, but, on the horizontal axis – we’re fellow citizens in God’s kingdom, brothers in Christ.

The message of Ephesians can be summed up in one simple sentence: “You have received supernatural grace for the glory of God, therefore, live in supernatural *unity* to the glory of God.”  Grace and peace.

## Purpose and Background

So, let’s turn to purpose and background.  Why was this letter written?  Unlike most of Paul’s letters, it wasn’t written in response to specific problems in the church.  Instead, it is a very general book.  So general, in fact, that it’s not even clear that it was written specifically to the Ephesians at all.  In most of your Bibles, you’ll see a footnote next to the word “Ephesus” in 1:1 saying that in many early manuscripts, the letter just says, “To the saints (blank), the faithful in Christ Jesus.”  It appears that this may have been intended for broad distribution, written to all the churches Paul had seen planted in the region of Ephesus during his nearly three-year stay there.  

Paul likely wrote this around 60AD, roughly 6 years after he left Ephesus, while he is in prison in Rome (3:1, 4:1).  And it is a glorious work of the Holy Spirit.  Let’s dive in.

## Overview

Though we won’t step through it, you’ll see an outline of the book on the back of your handout.  The main thing to notice there is how the book cleanly divides into two major sections -- Chapters 1-3, where unity is described as an accomplished fact, and then chapter 4-6 where unity is seen as a goal.  In other words, the book first describes unity as having been already accomplished by God, and then calls Christians to work toward the unity that’s not yet complete.  

By way of an overview, I’ll summarize the book using the little paragraphs that you see under each point throughout your handout.  

Praise be to God who predestined us to be redeemed through Christ, to the praise of his glorious grace.  I thank God and pray for you, that you may know Christ better as well as his power for you.  (1:1-23)  As for us, we were all dead in our sins, but God graciously made us alive to show his grace and end our boasting.  (2:1-10)  As a result, God has destroyed the barrier between Jew and Gentile, building them into a single building in which God lives by his Spirit. (2:11-22)  This is the mystery of which I am a herald and for which I am now suffering.  (3:1-13)  So I pray for the supernatural power of God to work this kind of unity in you.  (3:14-21)

Stopping there, let’s take a deeper look at the first half of the book, chapters 1-3.  (Turn back to the first page of your handout, where you’ll see our first point,)

## Chapter 1: God Elects

> Praise be to God who predestined us to be redeemed through Christ, to the praise of his glorious grace.  I thank God and pray for you, that you may know Christ better as well as his power for you.[^2]

In the first part of chapter 1, Paul praises God for electing sinners to redemption in Christ.  Let’s look at 1:3-4:  “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.” And then Paul goes on to describe these spiritual blessings:  God predestined us, he adopted us as sons, he redeemed us through the blood of Christ, he forgave our sins, he revealed his will to us.  As Paul understands it, our salvation is no “right” that we possess by virtue of birth, goodness, or anything else.  Election is a privilege we are given because of God’s great overflowing love for us in Christ.  The language here is stunning.  The riches of God’s grace that he “lavished” on us with all wisdom and understanding.  Salvation is nothing that we deserved, but entirely God’s choosing.  Some people think that the idea of God electing or choosing people to know him – even before the creation of the world, as it says in verse 3 – is inherently impersonal, transacational.  But this letter says that couldn’t be further from the truth:  verses 4 and 5, “in love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ!”  It’s because of God’s great love that sinners like us could become part of his family.  

If that is how much God has loved us, we should long to know God more.  The creator of the universe has loved his people from all eternity – why would we not want to seek him?!   And that’s exactly what Paul prays for these Christians in 1:15-23.  1:16:  “I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him” May that be the longing and prayer of our hearts too.  Moving on to our next section,

## 2:1-10: Election Based Purely on Grace

> As for us, we were all dead in our sins, but God graciously made us alive to show his grace and end our boasting.

In chapter one, we considered the gospel from the perspective of God’s electing grace.  And now we come to chapter two, where Paul shifts the perspective upside down;  we’ve seen it from God’s eyes, now, in 2:1, he says “And you were dead...”

What about us?  We were “*dead* in [our] trespasses and sins.”  At root we are co-conspirators against God and his sovereignty over his own creation.  And so, under his good judgment against us as sinners we are dead.  “But”, you see in verse four, “God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us... made us alive together with Christ –by grace you have been saved.”

These verses constitute one of the most glorious portrayals of our salvation in all of Scripture.  They make it clear that we can never make ourselves right with God through enough good works.  In fact, the question isn’t whether our good works will outweigh our bad:  it’s are we spiritually alive, or spiritually dead?  God must make us spiritually alive, so that we can repent of our sin and put our faith in Christ.  Then, as Paul says in verse 10 -- having been saved totally by grace, responding to God in faith – then we can do the good works God prepared in advance for us to do – not in order to be saved, but because we’ve already been saved.

What kind of good works does Paul have in mind?  Move ahead to our next section, where we see that:

## 2:11-3:13: The Primary Application of the Gospel is Unity

> As a result, God has destroyed the barrier between Jew and Gentile, building them into a single building in which God lives by his Spirit.  This is the mystery of which I am a herald and for which I am now suffering.

Paul begins with background: the Gentiles were at one time “separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.” (2:12).  But what happened?  Verse 14: Jesus “For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances” What’s that dividing wall?  Most literally, the wall that divided the court of the Jews from the court of the Gentiles in the temple.  The gospel has made peace between Jew and Gentile, and between them and God.

Paul then continues this thought into chapter 3, calling this a “mystery.”  Not a mystery as in something hard to understand, but something impossible to understand until Jesus revealed it to us.  What is this mystery?  Paul states in plainly in verse 6.  “This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.”

What’s going on here?  From the time of Abraham on, God’s people were defined ethnically.  That’s why Abraham’s descendants were prohibited from marrying with the nations around them.  But suddenly, that wall has been destroyed.  We are not saved, as we saw at the beginning of Chapter 2, based on our good works or our family tree — but based on the grace of God alone.  So the kingdom of God has now been extended to all peoples.

This idea of peace and unity between Jews and Gentiles is *the* central application of Ephesians.  Paul goes so far in verse 8 to state that preaching this unity was his mission.  “To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.” Again, what is the mystery?  Verse 6: Jews and Gentiles together in the church.  Unity is the primary application of the gospel.  The central calling of Paul’s ministry.  And, verse 10 says that this unity is central to God’s plan to bring glory to himself.  It reads, “so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.”

So if you’ve ever thought of unity in the church as being icing on the cake, something nice but not that important, we should think again.  Paul makes unity as fundamental to the application of the gospel as he could possibly express.  But, the necessity of the gospel message to we heard in chapters 1 and 2 to create real unity is striking.  Sometimes, especially in theologically liberal traditions, when individuals increasingly set aside the belief that Scripture is inspired by God and begin thinking instead that truth is discovered through one’s own subjective conclusions, they often begin emphasizing unity.  Unity becomes an end in and of itself: the idea of folks from all races and backgrounds together in a loving community.  But at the end of the day, unity doesn’t work unless something substantial actually unites you -- not just the idea of unity, but something so powerful that it really could join together all sorts of different people.  

Ironically, it’s the true gospel that brings this kind of real unity.  When we affirm that we are all depraved, that we are all dead spiritually, that we are in debt to God, that Christ is our only hope, a strange, helpless unity comes over us.  A group of admittedly sinful people has nothing to brag about.  So it is not surprising when the world’s most familiar barriers to unity are brought down in churches that are not focused on bringing them down but are focused instead on teaching the gospel faithfully and clearly.  That’s real unity – that kind of bond that as 2:19 says comes from being “saints and members of the household of God.”  And having established that that is the unity that God has created in the church, Paul moves in 3:14-21 to prayer...

## 3:14-21: Prayer for the Supernatural

> So I pray for the supernatural power of God to work this kind of unity in you.  

Does Paul realize that the unity he’s described is humanly impossible? I think he does.  That’s why he prays as he does in verses 14 through 21.

There are two things Paul prays for here.  First, v. 16, “according to the riches of his glory he may grand you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.” In other words, that through his Spirit God would give you the supernatural faith you need to accomplish this supernatural unity.  And second, “that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge.”  Why pray that we would know the full extent of Christ’s love for us?  Because that is what powers our love.  “We love because he first loved us.” (1 John 4:19)  
How are Jews to love Gentiles?  And how are we to love those in our own church with whom we have nothing in common but Christ?  Pray that we would comprehend the supernatural love He has shown us.  That will empower supernatural love for him and for each other.

And so it makes sense that Paul ends with his doxology, his praise, to the God who can do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.  How do we pray for the supernatural to happen?  We can use these verses as a blueprint, praying that his Spirit would give us supernatural faith, and that we would understand the supernatural love Christ has shown us in the gospel, so that we in turn might love with supernatural power.

## Why God Has Done This

Before we exit this first half of the book, though, I want to point out something I’ve skipped over.  Perhaps nowhere else in Scripture do we see such a concise description not just of what God has done but why.  Why did God create the world?  Why did he reconcile us to himself in grace and grant us peace with one another in the church?  Let me retrace our steps so far, and introduce you to three reasons behind God’s purposes.

### First, God has done all this For the Praise of His Grace

Look back at chapter 1, verse 5.  “he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will.” Why?  Because we’re so wonderful?  No.  Verse 6: “to the praise of his glorious grace.”  And similarly in verse 11, “In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory.”  God did these things to showcase the immensity of his grace.  

That’s what we see again in 2:7.  Why did God raise us from being spiritually dead?  “so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.”

### For the Praise of His Wisdom

But there is a second answer to the question “why.”  It’s for the praise of his wisdom.  Look at 3:10.  Paul is explaining his calling to preach the gospel so that Jews and Gentiles might be united in Christ.  He says, God’s “who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.”  Why is church such an uncomfortable place to be sometimes?  Because these are people with whom you have nothing in common but Jesus.  But that’s exactly God’s plan.  When we are able to love each other supernaturally, it makes such a statement about God’s wisdom in creating the church that even beings outside our physical world sit up and take notice.  The church is the crown jewel that displays God’s infinite wisdom to the whole cosmos!

### For the Glory of God

And there is a third answer — it somewhat encompasses the other two.  God did all this for his own glory.  Look at 3:20-21.  “Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.”

God will be glorified forever in the way we his people are redeemed, in the way we live it out, and in the way we will forever be his.  God has decided to bring glory to himself through our redemption — we who are sinners!  Isn’t this amazing!  The all-powerful God of the universe chooses to glorify himself through us, his church.  We display the character of God to his creation, and so we bring him glory.  That’s God’s purpose for all that he does, and that is the driving force behind this first half of Ephesians.  ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?

## Intro to Second Half

And that takes us to chapter 4.  Thus far, the letter has been entirely descriptive.  God has chosen us.  He has rescued us from death.  He has destroyed the wall between Jew and Gentile.  But starting in chapter 4, Paul’s language turns from the indicative to the imperative.  Verse 1: “I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called.” Just like we did with the first three chapters, let me summarize what we see here in the last three; again, you’ll see this summary across your handout.

Keep the unity of the Spirit required by your new lives in Christ; (4:1-6) to accomplish this, God has given us gifts to build unity.  (4:7-16)  So you must no longer live as godless Gentiles.  Instead, speak the truth, building each other up and forgiving just as Christ forgave you. (4:17-5:2)  Don’t misunderstand me, however, I am not telling you to have unity with those who lie and say that immorality is okay. (5:3-14)  Instead, make the most of every opportunity (5:15-20), submitting to each other in the following ways: (5:21) Wives, submit to your husbands; husbands love your wives as Christ did the church. (5:22-32).  Children, obey your parents; fathers, bring your children up in the training of the Lord. (6:1-4)  Slaves, obey your earthly masters; masters, treat your slaves with respect and fear since you serve the same master. (6:5-9)  Finally, put on the full armor of God so that you can continue to stand, praying even for me, that I might continue to stand. (6:10-20).  So first,

## 4:1-5:2: Build One Another Up

> Keep the unity of the Spirit required by your new lives in Christ; to accomplish this, God has given us gifts to build unity.  So you must no longer live as godless Gentiles.  Instead, speak the truth, building each other up and forgiving just as Christ forgave you.

Now that we’re firmly in the application section of this epistle, it becomes critical to tie these commands back to the first three chapters of the book.  Chapter 4, verses 1-3 is, in a sense, a summary of how we should live based on all we’ve discussed in chapters 1-3, and thus it’s also a summary of the challenge that chapters 4-6 set out to address.  “I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”

All of the admonitions in Ephesians 4-6 are answering the question “how can we keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace?” in a congregation so diverse that it even encompasses Jews and Gentiles.

Chapter 4 answers this challenge very practically.

### Gifts

For starters, we use the gifts that Christ has given us — apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. (4:11)  As with every other examination of Spiritual gifts in his letters, Paul makes it clear that the goal of gifts is the unity of the church, not our own personal fulfillment.  We so often think that we have received gifts, and must use gifts, in order to be fulfilled as individuals.  Paul writes that gifts are given the church “for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God . . . “ (4:12b-13)  And notice what the result is when those gifts are put to use to guard the unity of the church.  Orthodoxy, sound doctrine.  Verse 14: then we will no longer be “tossed to a fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.” As Bible-believing evangelicals, we often think of unity as a goal that, if pursued, might compromise what we believe.  But in fact, when we pursue unity founded on the gospel as God intends, that unity is what protects us from compromising our doctrine.

### Wisdom

Next, Paul says that unity in the church depends on us living in wisdom.  When we were spiritually dead, he says in verse 18, we were “darkened” in our understanding and separated from God because of the ignorance in our hardened hearts.  Now, though, we are called to put off the old self with its evil desires, and, verse 23, to “be renewed in the spirit of your minds.”  Paul is telling us that fleeing sin and living in godliness starts with our minds.  If we pay attention to God’s wisdom rather than the fleeting desires of the flesh, we will grow in righteousness and the church will grow in unity.

### Speech

The next thing we see in this passage is that we can use our speech to build each other up.  We are not to lie (v. 25), speak in sinful anger (v. 26), or use unwholesome talk (v. 29) but speak in ways that build others up.  And we are to forgive each other as Christ forgave us. (v. 32)

### Money

And we can build each other up with our finances as well.  Verse 28 is a great, and humbling, purpose statement for your work: “Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.”  If you’ve ever thought that being motivated by earning money when you work is necessarily vulgar and ungodly, I’d encourage you to spend some time with this verse.  Money can be a good and Godly motivation for work.  But Paul moves on from these encouragements to a section of caution:

## 5:3-14: Do Not Partner with Darkness

> Don’t misunderstand me, however, I am not telling you to have unity with those who lie and say that immorality is okay.

Now we get to chapter 5, when Paul’s tone turns from encouragement to warning.  Verses 5-7:  “For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceived you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not become partners with them.” (5:5-7)

Wow!  Quite a shift from love and forgiveness.  What’s going on here?  In a letter about gospel unity, Paul takes time to warn us about a wrong kind of unity.  A congregation should never seek unity in diversity if it means tolerance for greed, impurity, impropriety, or immorality.  God’s people are to separate themselves from such things.

Christians are to run to each other with open arms, regardless of background or nationality.  But the severity of Paul’s language is indicative of how strongly we must also oppose any attempt to force unity where the gospel is not the ground of our friendship.  Instead, we should as the next section says,

## 5:15-6:9: Make the Most of Every Opportunity

> Instead, make the most of every opportunity, submitting to each other in the following ways: Wives, submit to your husbands; husbands love your wives as Christ did the church.  Children, obey your parents; fathers, bring your children up in the training of the Lord.  Slaves, obey your earthly masters; masters, treat your slaves with respect and fear since you serve the same master.

With that caveat behind us, Paul returns to answering the challenge he laid out in 4:3 — how can we keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace?  What he writes in the next few paragraphs might surprise you.

We should seek unity by living wisely, “making the best use of the time” as he says in 5:16.  That means being filled with the Spirit in verse 18, encouraging each other through song in verse 19.  And, most significantly, we are to make the most of every opportunity in our homes and workplaces as well, which is where Paul turns in the next verses by exhorting the Ephesians to “Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.” (5:21)  The remainder of chapter 5 and beginning of chapter 6 are specific ways in which we must submit to each other.

These passages are likely familiar to most of you.  5:22-33 contains profound teaching on marriage, viewing marriage as designed to image Christ’s love for his church.  In chapter 6 is teaching on relationships between children and parents, and between slaves and their masters.  We certainly should note that when Paul tells wives to submit to their husbands and for husbands to sacrificially love their wives, he’s speaking about how the distinct, complementary roles that God has ordained for men and women in marriage provide a picture of Christ’s relationship to the church.  All throughout Paul’s writings and the whole Bible, it’s clear that men and women have equal dignity, value, and worth but complementary roles in the home and in the church.  We could spend all day on this or on any number of other issues that this section raises, but where I want to focus is what we learn when we put these passages into their overall context.

The first thing to notice is that this idea of headship and submission is under the larger point of “making the best use of the time” from 5:16.  Have you ever thought of submission in that category?  Not as an inconvenient or difficult to understand burden — but God’s design for how we might make the most of this life for his glory.  And then moving to the larger context — these commands sit within a book on how the gospel drives unity in the church between those who have nothing in common but Christ.  What this means is that your marriage matters for more than just its own sake.  It images Christ’s love for his church, his body.  And when roles of husband and wife are attended to, your marriage contributes to unity within God’s new society of the church.  So, marriage is far more profound than merely a bond between two people – it’s one of the ways that God pictures his love for us, and therefore it’s one of the ways that God builds unity in his church.

## 6:10-23: Stand to the End

> Finally, put on the full armor of God so that you can continue to stand, praying even for me, that I might continue to stand.

And that brings us to the famous section on spiritual warfare in 6:10.  Remember, that’s where we began this section.  The end of chapter 3 is a prayer for the supernatural to happen; chapter 6 ends with a description of the supernatural at work.  But now the call is a broader one — the call to stand.  Paul repeats that word four times.  So if you read through chapter 6, expect Paul to stare you in the eye and tell you to “Stand!  Stand!  Stand!.”  Not an easy thing to do.  If you reach the end of your days on earth and can say that you have stood fast, what an accomplishment to the glory of God!  And so Paul tells the Ephesians to put on the whole armor of God.  To be strong in the Lord.

And so how appropriate are his last words of instruction:  “take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel.” (6:18-19)

Now doesn’t that get your heart?  There is Paul in prison, an old man, praying and asking others to pray that God would make him fearless.  Paul knew courage was needed to continue, and so he asked for it.  And that is where this book on the unity that comes from the gospel concludes: with Paul desiring to continue to preach this gospel, so that the unity of the church might continue to grow.  

ANY QUESTIONS?

# Colossians: New Life In Christ

Unlike the letter to the Ephesians, Paul wrote his letter to the Colossian Christians to counter a very specific heresy. It seems that some were teaching these young Christians that life and wisdom were found through the powers of our own human faculties. In chapter 2:8 we read, “See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.”  

At the heart of much of this false teaching was the idea that the gospel of Jesus Christ is a great start, but there is so much more on offer. That is, Jesus is the beginning, but there are other ways to receive “fullness” in the Christian life. This was to be received by specially-revealed wisdom, perhaps with particular understanding of the Jewish law, and perhaps through angelic encounters.

This is a three-pronged attack on the sufficiency of Jesus Christ.

- Judaizing and Gnostic tendencies deny the finality of Christ’s work.
- Their preoccupation with angelic experiences denies the preeminence of Christ.
- And asceticism denies our need for Christ.

In response, Paul wrote to remind them that the life of the Kingdom is found ultimately in Christ, and Christ alone.  In Christ we find new life.  Through Christ’s death we die to our old lives, and through his life we are given new life.  Our new lives are characterized by transformed relationships with God and with others.  And as a result, the life of the Kingdom is a cross-centered life.  

But before we dive into to the letter itself, a little background.

## Background & Date

It seems that Paul wrote and sent Ephesians and Colossians together.  There is considerable overlap between the two letters, and Paul mentions Tychicus at the end of both letters as the one who likely delivered them.  If you were to read the two letters back to back, you would likely get the distinct impression that Ephesians was the general letter (you’ll recall it was likely written as a circular letter to a whole group of churches in Asia Minor), while Colossians deals with many of the same themes but was addressed to the needs of one particular church.  Unlike Ephesus, Paul never visited Colossae, even though it was only 100 miles east of Ephesus. Nevertheless, he had been instrumental in that church’s founding, through the conversion of Epaphras, who he then sent with the gospel to Colossae.  Like the letter to the Ephesians, it appears that Paul wrote this while in prison in Rome, around 60AD. (4:3, 10, 18).

## Outline

So then, what do we find in this letter?  Well, not surprising given its audience of a particular church, the letter begins with a fairly lengthy introduction that focuses on Paul’s aim for this (and every) church is that we “walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. Ay you strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.” (1:10-13).  Quite a run-on sentence, but quite an amazing picture of our objective in this Christian life.

From there, Paul steps right into the meat of his letter with one of the most amazing portraits of Christ that we find anywhere in Scripture.  “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation” (1:15) and on from there through verse 20 of chapter one.  From there, Paul turns his attention to the primary implication of who Christ is for the Colossians: their reconciliation with God that you see in 1:21 through verse 23.  These two truths: who Christ is, and who we are as a result, are the theological core of this book.  And Paul steps back for a moment, 1:24-2:3, to consider his own work to support those great truths.

Then, beginning in 2:4 on through the end of chapter 2, we read on to see the alternative that has been placed in front of these Christians.  It stems from “philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to the Christ.”  (verse 8).  Paul pauses for a moment to remind us (beautifully) of the gospel, and then continues describing this false teaching in verse 16.  It is consumed with tradition — religious festivals, new moon celebrations, Sabbath days.  It delights in false humility (verse 18) and the worship of angels and a celebration of that mystical experience.  It is ascetic, imposing strict rules on the body (verses 20-23).  Tellingly, Paul observes, verse 23, that “These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.”  A very good litmus test for evaluating different strands of teaching in our own day.

And then Paul turns, in chapter 3, to how we should live as Christians — the implications of the true gospel that do in fact result in changed lives, in real restraint of sensual indulgence.  He covers how we should live together in holiness, how our families should function, and how we should behave toward others in the broader community.  And then, with another round of personal greetings, Paul ends his letter with chapter four.

## Major Themes

Now, with that as an overview, I’d like to turn this letter over thematically and try to parse out its primary message to us.

How exactly does Paul address the false teaching that is threatening to turn the Colossians away from Christ to the wisdom of this world?  Two big things that I want you to notice.

### 1. First, the Christian’s new life comes from God through Christ alone

In Christ we have received new life.  Before (2:13) “you were dead in your trespasses” but now “God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.”  Before (3:1-4) your minds were set on “the things that are on earth” but now your minds and hearts are set “on things that are above.”  Before (2:21) we lived life as enemies of God, alienated from him, but now, we live “in a manner worthy of the Lord” (1:10).  This new life changes the way we relate to God and to other people.  But if we jump straight into how we should live and forget the source of that — that our new life comes from God — we will find ourselves lined up squarely with these false teachers preaching a gospel based on our own strength, derived from our own wisdom and traditions, that — in the end — is powerless against the sinfulness of our own hearts.  

### 2. And second, the Christian’s new life is displayed in relationships with other people

As a result of the cross, not human wisdom, Christians’ lives are changed. It may be that your mind used to be set on partying on the weekend, or expanding your portfolio, or just making sure that no one messed with you. Now think about what your priories are: loving others sacrificially, spreading the gospel, pleasing God.

Let’s look at these two main points in more detail.

## A.  From God

First, our new life is a gift from God.  Paul thanks God for the Colossians’ faith, knowing that God is the author of it (1:3).  He prays: “giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.”  (1:12-14)  In his prayer he acknowledges that God rescues, strengthens, qualifies, and redeems us.

Let’s note two things about God’s gift of new life to us.  First, God gives us this new life through Christ.  “For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,” Paul writes (2:9).  “And you, who were dead in your trespasses... God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.” (2:13) Christ is the source of our life and his death and resurrection is the means by which God applies that life to us.  Paul writes “For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.” (3:3-4) This is what baptism symbolizes, and why baptism is the public sign of our profession of faith.  Paul writes, “In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.” (2:11-12) Incidentally, Colossians is one of the clearest places in the New Testament where we understand what baptism means.  Often, people have suggested that baptism is a continuation of the covenant of circumcision in the Old Testament — and thus should be applied to our children even before they are saved.  And sure enough, in 2:11-12, Paul does indeed parallel baptism with circumcision.  But he takes pains to show that the circumcision he is referring to is not physical circumcision “done by the hands of men” but circumcision of the heart.  And just as circumcision of the heart was a reference to faith in the Old Testament, so baptism today is only for those who have experienced that same faith.

Second, if God gives us this new life through Christ, we should also note that God gives us this new life through Christ alone.  No other person, achievement, idea, or human effort will avail us.  And this idea of salvation through Christ alone is critical as Paul defends the gospel from these false teachers.  Paul calls Christ  “God’s mystery... in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” (2:2-3).  To that end Paul warns the Colossians not to be deceived or taken captive “with plausible arguments.” (2:4), “philosophy and empty deceit,” “human tradition,” or the “elemental spirit of the world,” (2:8).  The Colossians evidently were being led astray by relying on ritual, asceticism, angel worship, and fashionable philosophy.  “Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath... Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,” (2:16, 18).  These are serious temptations.  As I read earlier, Paul acknowledges that “such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body,” but ultimately “These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.” (2:22-23).

Beware of Christianity *plus* something else.  Christianity — with a dash of Buddhism.  Christianity and a daily regime of meditation and exercise.  Christianity modernized with New Age sensibility.  Christianity made intellectually respectable with Plato or Aristotle.  Christianity made easy with a fixed calendar of prayers and recitations and scented candles.  There are a lot of formulas for how to augment the Bible with something else.  Lots of Christians feel the pull to mix their faith with something else, whether it is philosophy, asceticism, other religions, or elaborate ceremonies and rituals.  The problem is that the something else ends up becoming more important and conflicting with fundamental truths of Scripture.  The book of Colossians is a good place to go to reflect on the sufficiency and supremacy of God’s work in Christ — and the resulting simplicity of the Christian faith.

There isn’t anything wrong with simply studying other world religions or philosophy.  Such study can help us become better evangelists and apologists for the faith.  And there is nothing wrong with participating in shared corporate worship — that will over time, develop its own habits and characteristics.  But these things should never become substitutes for Christ, or even necessary additions to Christ.  We can change our rituals and still worship God.  We can go our entire Christians lives without an angelic encounter or even a dramatic spiritual “experience” and still be faithful.  We can become perfectly knowledgeable about the faith without studying the philosophers’ commentaries on it.  Paul strongly cautions the Colossians always to remember that Christ alone is fully sufficient to bring us to “fullness” and to give us “new life.”  In fact Paul gives one of the strongest statements of Christ’s supremacy and sufficiency in all Scripture in 1:15-20:

> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.  For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities –All things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.”  

Nothing can compare with Christ!  

## B.  For God and Others

That was the first thing I wanted you to notice: our new life comes from God through Christ alone.  And the second: this new life is lived for God’s glory and according to his purposes.  God is not only the source of our new life:  God’s character is the model for our new life and His will is a guide for our new life.

As I mentioned earlier, Paul prays that the Christians in Colossae would live “so as to walk in a manner worthy of the lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.” (1:10-12).  Our lives are to be worthy of God and pleasing to him, which means that our lives should be marked by increasing knowledge about God, thankfulness for all that he has given us, and patience with the trials and temptations of this life.  Paul reiterates this theme in 2:6, where he writes that the truth of the gospel “which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing –as it also does among you, since the day  you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth.” 

Paul tells the Colossians that their new life in Christ should have real implications for how they live their lives and how they treat each other.  Because “you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.” (3:9-10) he expects them to “put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices” (3:8-9). In their new life, they are to live differently.  “Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one  has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.” (3:12-14) Our new life starts with a new heart, with new attitudes, with a new approach and a new way of thinking about and responding to the world.

Practically speaking, this new way of living shows itself in our relationships with other people.  In chapter 3 Paul gives guidance to different groups of people in their key relationships, focusing on the family.  “Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.” (3:18-21).  Our new life in Christ should be evident first in how we treat our family members.  This can be especially challenging because our family members are precisely the people we often take for granted.  It can be tempting to treat one’s home as the place where we no longer have to be polite or kind, where we are allowed to “relax,”—in other words, let’s be honest, to be selfish with our words and our time.  But Paul is very specific:  the home is where we begin to live our new lives.  Note that while the roles differ—wife, husband, children—the theme is the same:  love.

We also live our new lives in the workplace.  Paul gives guidance to “bondservants” which parallels loosely with our concept of “servants,” and to “masters.”  “Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.” (3:22-24). Now modern employees in this country typically have far more rights and privileges in the workplace than ancient servants did in theirs.  Yet Paul was telling servants in the ancient world to “obey” with “sincerity of heart,” and to “work heartily.”  If they, with far fewer rewards, were to work with sincerity and hard effort, how much more should we?  This can be difficult, because complaining about our jobs is pretty much the entire content of our small talk at parties and lunches here in Washington, D.C.  Yet Paul reminds us that we should be grateful to work and should be careful to honor God with or labor.  We should eagerly seek to please our employers, genuinely from the heart.  We shouldn’t do just enough to get by, or only perform when the boss is watching.  I think Paul is saying that we should take pride in our work, even enjoy it!  Finally, Paul adds a word for employers.  “Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.”

So our new life should show itself in our relationships with our family, in the workplace, and in all of our interactions generally.  As Paul is winding down his short letter to the Colossians, he counsels them to “Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.” (4:5-6) This new life should simply be a way of life evident in everything we do, in all that we say, to every person we meet and with whom we interact.

Because our new life is so important and so all-encompassing, we must strive to endure to the end.  “He has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.” (1:22-23).  We must persevere to the end to receive the fullness of our new lives with him in the new creation.  That is why Paul prays that the Colossians would have “all endurance and patience with joy,” (1:11).  We know that our perseverance is guaranteed by God who enables us to live through his Spirit, yet we also see here in Colossians that we must strive every day to live out this perseverance.

And all of this, if we understand it correctly, is impossible if we don’t understand the Christ and the gospel laid out in the first half of the letter.  So as you study this book, spend good time considering and meditating on Paul’s words in the first chapter.  Consider this God-centered, God-powered, God-glorifying gospel that we have received, and then — only then — read on and contemplate how it should evidence itself in your life.

## C.  Conclusion

Paul’s letter to the Colossians teaches us that in Christ we have received new life.  We are dead to our sins and made alive through him.  And Christ alone is sufficient for our new lives.  He is the “image of the invisible God” in whom the fullness of God dwells.  Compared to the absolute supremacy of Christ, nothing else compares.  Sophisticated philosophy, angelic encounters, beautiful rituals, ancient traditions, supposedly secret knowledge, New Age spiritualism, and anything else simply pales in comparison to Christ the King.

And our new lives bring new relationships.  We relate in a fundamentally new way to God.  We have peace with him, seek to grow in knowledge of him, and obey his will for our lives.  We relate in a new way as well to our families, friends, colleagues, and co-workers.  We are no longer marked by “sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness” but by “compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.” And we are called to persevere in this new life to the end — with God’s help through his Spirit.  That is the message of Colossians.  Which brings us to Philemon.

# Philemon: Reconciliation

Philemon is the shortest of Paul’s letters.  It is also unique in that it is not a letter to a church, but to an individual church member.  It’s a personal letter from Paul on behalf of Philemon's runaway slave Onesimus who served alongside Paul (we assume Onesimus became a Christian after he ran away).  Paul's compassion and love for the young man is apparent when he calls him "my child."  He has sent him back to ask for forgiveness.

Before we go further, let me say a word about slavery in the NT. To begin with, we want to be careful not to read 18th and 19th century race-based chattel slavery back into the 1st century. In Paul’s day, though some slavery was the result of warfare, most was of an economic kind more akin to indentured servanthood. Rome was full of doctors, lawyers and teachers who were slaves And it was not based on race.  That said, the New Testament never excuses slavery, nor exonerates slave holders. It does not try to set up an alternative political-economic system. Rather, as Paul does here, it seeks to bring the implications of the gospel to bear on both slave and master.

## Major Themes and Message

The theme of reconciliation through the power of Christ, the cross-centered life, runs throughout the book of Colossians (written to the church attended by the recipients of this note).  __Reconciliation__ is put into practice in the book of Philemon, in a very real way.  Paul is asking one man to forgive another who has wronged him directly. Both are asked to do something difficult.

*Onesimus is a picture of someone who needs forgiveness.*  Paul has sent Onesimus back to his employer whom he had wronged.  Now Onesimus would turn up at Philemon’s house with nothing but a letter from Paul in his hand.  Can you imagine the former slave standing in the doorway as his former employer opens the door — needing forgiveness, helpless to repay, cared for only by someone far away in prison.  In one sense, the destitution of this former slave is incomparable.  He can offer nothing, and he deserves punishment.  

Philemon, for his part, may not have found it easy to forgive.  *By forgiving Onesimus, he might be regarded as showing weakness.  He might bring shame upon himself among his neighbors for treating a runaway employee, or indentured servant, this way.  Perhaps he worries that such leniency would encourage Onesimus to view his crime lightly.  Perhaps it would also encourage others to follow Onesimus’s example and let them think they too would get off lightly.*  Any of you who have exercised authority in the workplace know the tension between justice and mercy towards your employees.

Why does Paul make this request? So that the love of Christ and the reconciling, redeeming power of the gospel, might be displayed.  Paul is a peacemaker, and he is pushy about it!  Note how Paul goes about pleading with Philemon.  Onesimus had become a Christian, and so Paul identifies himself closely with Onesimus.  Onesimus is “my child,” (10) and “my very heart,” (12) and “beloved brother –especially to me,” (16).  He even says “receive him as you would receive me.” (17) and offers to pay Onesimus’ debts (18).  Paul enters into Onesimus’ world and identifies closely with him and his trials.  From within that position Paul pleads with Philemon not for Onesimus’ sake, but for his own.  What a picture of what Christ has done for us!  When we join ourselves to him, he identifies with us and pleads with the Father on our behalf.  Paul is simply following Christ’s example in seeking reconciliation between two believers.

Paul’s use of the situation offers a model and an example of pastoral ministering, counseling, and forgiveness.  When confronting someone, appeal to the love that they have known in Christ. Have confidence that if you are speaking to a Christian then the Lord will work love in them. We don’t need to manipulate one another. Just as in Colossians, we can hold out the gospel to one another, trusting that it is the only sufficient grounds for transformation.

And Onesimus, for his part, is in the situation we are all in before God.  We can offer nothing to God.  We deserve punishment.  And we are desperately in need of his forgiveness.  We can only imagine how Onesimus must have felt when Paul told him he had to return to Philemon, or what it was like to carry that letter back to his employer.  Do you remember what it was like the first time you realized the depth of your sin and the justice of God’s wrath against you?  Paul’s little letter offers a good opportunity to meditate on that and call it to mind again.  *We need God’s condescending, self-lowering love in our own lives, offered to us only because Christ has met the demands of justice for all who repent and believe.  We need to be forgiven, and we need to forgive, if we would have true Christian faith.*

## Conclusion

What then is the life of the Kingdom? It is a life that from first to last is marked by the grace that we have been shown in and through Christ. A grace that unites us, a grace that animates us, a grace that has changed us, so that we might indeed be a display of the glory of God, and Jesus words might be fulfilled, that all men would know that we are his disciples, because of our love for one another.
